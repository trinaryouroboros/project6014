## Historical info ##

For those living in our dimension, the Orz is apparently race of aquatic aliens, in reality they are merely the "fingers" of what the Orz truly is.

The Orz is an entity that exists as a multi dimensional-organism. When the Taalo slipped in "Pretty space" with their IDF technology, their presence there created a nook in the "body" of the Orz. The Orz, irritated by the Taalo spread it's fingers into "Pretty space" but were ever since unable to catch the Taalo.

A couple of ten thousand years later -- by our definition of time -- the Orz sensed the Androsynth meddling with IDF technology, and as a reaction it spread it's "fingers" into our dimension. The Androsynth living in the Vulpeculae constellation disappeared, though a small population of them still live in the Armstrong constellation. The Orz might have taken an interest in our dimension, since it didn't pull it's fingers back, but left them where they are and through them it helped the Captain succeed in defeating the Ur-Quan, however whatever motivation stays behind such actions is still a mystery.

## Orzspace ##

By the time the game starts, strange dimensional portals have already opened up at hyperspace coordinates identical to certain stars. They are huge dark holes replacing all objects of these star systems, whose fate remains unknown -- yet strangely enough, these star systems still create gravity wells in hyperspace. As much as the manifestations in truespace can be considered the "fingers" of the Orz entity, these portals can be considered it's "maws", leading to the inside of it's "body". Similarly to quasispace in UQM, the Captain can shorten his journey by using these portals to bypass long hyperspace distances.

Traveling inside orzspace, the Captain may encounter pursuers that can be described as "antibodies". Any contact with an antibody results in the Captain's destruction and therefore the end of the game.

From conversations with Androsynth trapped in **Orzspace**:

> CAPTAIN: We know the Orz. They are those fish-folk in light blue ships that helped us win the war.
> ANDROSYNTH:
> Yes, that's how you see it.
> They are part of a single entity, they are its fingers sticking out into the reality we used to inhabit. It could well exist there in a less tangible form if it chose to.
> But what we understand of it, that is one of its **time jokes**, masquerading to resemble its environment. What you perceive as Orz in your dimension are made of the atoms and molecules that used to compose the bodies of Androsynth. Reorganized, re-structured... recycled.
> Yet the patterns of our minds and bodies were pulled in and reside here inside the Orz's **mind-skin**. We are like memories. Ghosts... echoes of past.
> CAPTAIN: But that's horrible! Why does it do that?
> ANDROSYNTH:
> We believe it is easier for it to modify existing structures than to construct vessels for interacting with other beings from scratch.
> As any force in the universe it naturally chooses the easiest path. It is unlikely it even recognizes sentient life as we do due to its different way of understanding and manipulating time and space.
> It **remembers** anything it touches and we are an example of its memories.We sense it sees no wrong in doing what it does and that makes it even more dangerous.
> As for why its projections constantly resemble nautical lifeforms we are not sure of. Perhaps their appearance is a reflection of what Orz looked like in early stages of its evolution.
> Perhaps it is an echo of one of the species it has **assimilated**. From time to time we can hear those other beings, but most of them are too alien for us to even try to understand.
> They are locked in their own sections, trapped like us.
