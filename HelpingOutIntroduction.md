# Greetings Hunams! #

You want to help? Great! We could always use help. Many people want to help, but unfortunately all they do is end up wasting our valuable time. There are four pillars, all equally important that make the team.


# The Team: #

**Programmers**: Quite simply, the more programmers we have, the better the game is going to be. You NEED to know C++.  If you can't read C code, then we probably can't use you.

> Download the code here:
> http://code.google.com/p/project6014/source/checkout

> And download the read only.  If you can compile it, understand it, and can improve on it, we'll give you write access.
> http://code.google.com/p/project6014/wiki/Contributing

> Questions? Vist the [dev forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/project6014-dev).
**Artists**: We've got some talented artists on the team. But you have to take a look at the existing artwork.  If you can't match the style of the existing artwork then sorry... we probably can't use your art skills. Animators, 2D Artists, and 3D artists. Send a portfolio of your stuff to dczanik (at@) gmail.com.


**Writers**: Writing is tricky! The problem isn't the writing. It's getting people to agree on a good story. We've spent 20 years thinking about how a sequel should look.  We're ALL passionate about this. We all want this to be great. This has lead to a lots of great discussions but very little writing. This is not a forum. If you are on the team as a writer, writing is your job. Start writing. But first, let's see what you can do.

> Right now, we're focused on getting writers than can follow the plot (as discussed in the wiki). You've got to take the existing plot line and write a story. Nothing is set in stone. If something isn't working, we can change it. But for now, you must follow the story.

> This is the easiest way to contribute is to learn the dialogue langue:
> http://code.google.com/p/project6014/wiki/DialogLanguage

> Write something good for the aliens with little to no/dialog.
> And test the dialog here:
> http://mooses.nl/uqm/wip/js-dialogue/#

> Currently the aliens that need dialog are:

> [Arilou](http://code.google.com/p/project6014/wiki/Ariloulaleelay), [Baul](http://code.google.com/p/project6014/wiki/Baul), [Faz](http://code.google.com/p/project6014/wiki/Faz), [FoonFoon](http://code.google.com/p/project6014/wiki/FoonFoon), [FleeingRace](http://code.google.com/p/project6014/wiki/FleeingRace), [Mmrnmhrm](http://code.google.com/p/project6014/wiki/Mmrnmhrm), [Exotics](http://code.google.com/p/project6014/wiki/Exotics), or [Taalo](http://code.google.com/p/project6014/wiki/Taalo).

> It's got to be Feel like Star Control. Give us funny, sad, or touching moments. Bonus if you can make us feel all of those emotions. It needs to follow the plot line laid out, run in the [dialog editor](http://mooses.nl/uqm/wip/js-dialogue/#),

> Copy & paste that into a text file... and send it to dczanik (at@) gmail.com.  Any questions, post it on the [dev forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/project6014-dev).

> If it's good, we'll welcome you to the team. Once you're on the team, you can write alternate versions. It must be written out in the dialog format. No posting on the forums with an idea and expecting somebody else to do the work. We've tried that. It doesn't work.

> Another tip: try copying/pasting the unfinished [gameplay outline](http://project6014.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/sc2/doc/devel/gameplay.txt) into the [dialog editor](http://mooses.nl/uqm/wip/js-dialogue/#) or [read the wiki](http://code.google.com/p/project6014/wiki/DesignNotes) to see how the game would play out.

**Marketing**: We suck at marketing. This is the one place that non-artists, non-programmers, and bad writers can help. Forums, answering questions, and telling people about the game. The more people know about the game, the more people will be interested in helping. The more people helping, the better the game will be.

**Administrators**: Wait. Isn't that five pillars? Sorry, I was always bad at math. No, everybody on the team needs to be an administrator. Nobody wants to do it.  Technical support, keeping the team on track, offering constructive feedback, keeping everybody motivated, etc. We all need to do it.
