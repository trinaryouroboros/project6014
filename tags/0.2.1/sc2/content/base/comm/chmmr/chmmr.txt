#(CHMMR_GREETING_HOME_1)
WELCOME BACK, CAPTAIN. WE TRUST THE TEST DRIVE WENT SATISFACTORILY.
OUR FACILITIES ARE AT YOUR DISPOSAL.

#(CHMMR_GREETING2_HOME_2)
GREETINGS HUMAN, WELCOME BACK TO PROCYON. OUR FACILITIES ARE AT YOUR DISPOSAL.
HAVE YOU LOCATED THE SHOFIXTI CRASH SITE?

#(CHMMR_GREETING_SPACE_1)
WE GREET YOU, HUMAN CAPTAIN. WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM US?

#(CHMMR_GREETING_SPACE_2)
IS THERE ANY ASSISTANCE YOU MIGHT REQUIRE, HUMAN CAPTAIN?

#(CHMMR_GREETING_SPACE_3)
GREETINGS, HUMAN CAPTAIN. DO YOU REQUIRE OUR COUNSEL?

#(CHMMR_GREETING_SPACE_4)
WE GREET YOU HUMAN CAPTAIN. WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM US?

#(yes_but_dont_have)
I'm THIS close to finding it!

#(BRING_HERE)
ACT QUICK AND RETURN HERE WITH ANY UNUSUAL DISCOVERIES.
ONLY THE CHMMR HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ANALYSE THEIR MEANING.

#(not_yet)
Err, not yet actually, where is it again?

#(SEARCH_FOR_IT)
WE HAVE GIVEN YOU THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE LOCATION OF THE DISTRESS SITE.
WE SUGGEST YOU REFER TO THE COORDINATES ON YOUR STARMAP
AND SEARCH THE AREA MORE THOROUGHLY FOR IT.

#(can_we_ask)
Can we ask you some things?

#(YOU_CAN_ASK)
YOU MAY.

#(how_you_heard_call)
How come only you guys heard the Shofixti distress call?

#(HEARD_CALL_SO)
WE CHMMR HAVE INHERITED THE NATURAL SUSCEPTIBILITY
FOR HYPERWAVE TRANSMISSIONS
FROM OUR CHENJESU ANCESTORS.
EACH OF US IS CAPABLE OF PERCEIVING CERTAIN HYPERWAVE SIGNALS
AS YOU HUMANS ARE ABLE TO PERCEIVE OSCILLATIONS FROM 20 TO 20.000 HERTZ.
THIS UNIQUE SENSE OF OURS RIVALS MOST ARTIFICIAL HYPERWAVE RECEIVERS.
HOWEVER, THE SIGNAL WAS VERY FAINT.
A COMPARISON: SUPPOSE YOU HEAR A SOUND FROM VERY FAR AWAY, CAPTAIN.
YOU CANNOT PRECISELY PINPOINT THE DIRECTION IT CAME FROM
SINCE THE SOUND HAS ECHOED MULTIPLE TIMES FROM THE SURROUNDINGS ON ITS WAY.
A HYPERWAVE "ECHOES" FROM OBSTACLES
AND IMPERFECTIONS IN HYPERSPACE LIKEWISE.

#(where_distress_site)
So have you yet located the origin of the signal?

#(DONT_KNOW_LOCATION)
OUR TASK FORCE DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT DATA
ABOUT THE LOCATION.
WE SUGGEST YOU ENQUIRE FURTHER AT OUR STARBASE.

#(GIVE_DISTRESS_LOCATION)
WE HAVE BEEN INTERVIEWING OUR SOCIETY'S INDIVIDUALS
IN ORDER TO GATHER A DATABASE OF ESTIMATES OF THE ORIGIN.
WITH ALL THESE ESTIMATES WE HAVE COMPUTED AN AREA
THE SIGNAL CAME FROM WITH CERTAINTY.
WE WILL SEND THE DATA TO YOUR SYSTEMS NOW. 
YOU WILL SEE THE AREA ON YOUR STARMAP.
THIS IS THE BEST WE CAN DO WITH CURRENT DATA
BUT THE AREA IS STILL TOO LARGE FOR YOU TO SEARCH EFFICIENTLY.
WE SUGGEST YOU ASK THE SHOFIXTI FOR MORE INFORMATION
ON THEIR SCOUT PATROL MOVEMENTS.

#(better_starship)
This star-ship is lame, can I get a better one?

#(NO_BETTER_STARSHIP)
NO. 
YOUR SHIP IS AN EXPLORER VESSEL, IDEALLY SUITED TO THE TASK REQUIRED OF IT.

#(lame_landing_question_1)
Hey, I tried landing on Chmmr prime, but can't get the Explorer to acquire a stable orbit.

#(LAME_LANDING_ANSWER_1)
CAPTAIN, ALLIANCE CENTRAL COMMAND WISHES NOT TO PUBLICLY ADVERTISE
THE COMMISSION OF THIS CRAFT NOR ITS MISSION TO GENERAL POPULACE.
SUBSEQUENTLY, THE NAVIGATION MODULE OF YOUR SHIP HAS BEEN INSTRUCTED
NOT TO APPROACH HIGHLY POPULATED ALLIANCE PLANETS.

#(lame_landing_question_2)
So I cannot communicate with Alliance homeworlds?

#(LAME_LANDING_ANSWER_2)
PREFERABLY, COMMUNICATION SHOULD BE DONE WITH
ALLIANCE REPRESENTATIVES AT THEIR RESPECTIVE STARBASES.

#(lame_landing_question_3)
But I wish to see the famous crystal caves of Tzzrak-Tzon!

#(LAME_LANDING_ANSWER_3)
NEGATIVE, CAPTAIN. IT WOULD TAKE YOUR LANDER 724 MONTHS
TO REACH SURFACE FROM THE ORBIT YOU ARE ALLOWED TO ACQUIRE.
YOUR LANDER IS NOT SUITED TO CARRY PROVISIONS FOR SUCH A LENGTH OF TIME.
HOWEVER, WE MAY TRANSMIT PICTURES OF THE MAGNIFICENT TZZRAK-TZON TO YOU
IN HIGH RESOLUTION.

#(where_urquan)
What happened with the Ur-Quan?

#(URQUAN_ARE)
TO OUR BEST KNOWLEDGE THE UR-QUAN KZER-ZA REGROUPED
AND LEFT THIS PART OF THE GALAXY
SHORTLY AFTER THE SA-MATRA WAS DESTROYED.
THEY KNEW THEY WERE NO MATCH FOR OUR AVATAR STARSHIPS IN THEIR CURRENT STATE. 
IT MAY BE THAT THEY WILL RETURN WITH RENEWED HOSTILITY.

#(where_kohrah)
Had any luck expelling the Kohr-Ah?

#(KOHRAH_ARE)
THE KOHR-AH STILL POPULATE THIS REGION OF SPACE AND REMAIN A MENACE
EVEN IF THEY ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO LAY SIEGE TO STAR SYSTEMS LIKE THEY ONCE WERE.
WE WORK WITH THE YEHAT TO DESTROY ROGUE MARAUDER VESSELS.

#(why_kohrah_still_here)
Why do the Kohr-ah still linger?

#(KOHRAH_HERE_BECAUSE)
THE KOHR-AH PRIMAT AND ALMOST ALL OF HER AIDES WERE AMONG THOSE
GUARDING THE SA-MATRA WHEN IT WAS DESTROYED.
THE KOHR-AH ARE NOW WITHOUT LEADERS
AND ROAM THE GALAXY AS INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT DIRECTION.
THE UR-QUAN KZER-ZA DID NOT MAKE SUCH A MISTAKE.
WE KNOW THAT THE KOHR-AH WILL REMAIN A THREAT TO SPECIES ACROSS THE GALAXY
SHOULD THEY RE-ORGANISE THEMSELVES.
THIS IS WHY IT IS IMPERATIVE WE DESTROY AS MANY AS POSSIBLE WHILE THEY ARE WEAKENED.
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE REMAINING KOHR-AH STILL TERRORISE
POPULATED PLANETS BEYOND THE ALLIANCE'S REACH.

#(yehat_not_impressed)
The Yehat don't seem too impressed by how you've thrown your weight around in the New Alliance of Free Stars.

#(CHMMR_ARE_AWESOME)
THE CHMMR HAVE INTELLECT AND WISDOM NEVER BEFORE SEEN IN THIS GALAXY.
WE HAVE DRAWN FROM THE BEST QUALITIES OF CHENJESU AND MMRNMHRM.
OUR LEVELS OF TECHNOLOGY ARE ALREADY UNPARALLELED.
OUR PRE-EMINENCE CANNOT BE QUESTIONED. THE PROCESS WAS FLAWLESS AND WE HAVE EMERGED SO.

#(pterodactyls_know_nothing)
Fair enough, what would a flock of super-pterodactyls know anyway! I ask you.

#(SPEAK_TO_YEHAT)
WE WILL SPEAK TO THE YEHAT ABOUT THIS CHANGE OF ATTITUDE.

#(chenjesu_guiding_light)
In the good old days the Chenjesu were first among equals, more a guiding light than leaders as such.

#(CHMMR_PROTECT)
IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS YOU SPEAK OF THE CHENJESU-LED ALLIANCE WAS RESOUNDINGLY DEFEATED BY THE UR-QUAN HIERARCHY.
THE CHMMR WILL TAKE WHATEVER STEPS NECESSARY 
SO THAT A SIMILAR FATE DOES NOT BEFALL THE NEW ALLIANCE OF FREE STARS.
THIS IS OUR PURPOSE. WE WILL SPEAK TO THE YEHAT ABOUT THIS CHANGE OF ATTITUDE.

#(on_our_way)
We'll be on our way now.

#(GOODBYE_HUMAN1)
MAKE HASTE HUMAN. YOU MAY RECREW AND REFUEL AT OUR STARBASE.

#(im_not_comfortable)
I know I don't speak on behalf of Earth on this matter but personally I'm not comfortable with slave shielding other races as the Ur-Quan have done.

#(CHMMR_LECTURE)
EARTHLING, YOU KNOW LITTLE ABOUT WHAT IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM THE TERRORS OF SPACE.
THE MYCON AND VUX WOULD NOT THINK TWICE ABOUT WIPING OUT HUMANITY AND THE OTHER ALLIANCE RACES.
THEIR PAST ACTIONS PROVE THIS. IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE UNDER A SLAVE SHIELD THAT THEY CANNOT HARM YOU.
THE CHMMR DRAW ON THE ACCUMULATED WISDOM OF CHENJESU AND MMRNMHRM.
THERE IS LITTLE REASON FOR YOU TO QUESTION.

#(you_know_best)
Well, you know best!

#(no_race_evil)
No race is purely evil, their actions are a consequence of their environment. Perhaps The Alliance should do more for the VUX and Mycon. Now that the Ur-Quan are defeated they are no longer a threat.

#(CONSEQUENCE)
THERE MUST ALSO BE CONSEQUENCE TO THEIR ACTIONS.
THIS CONVERSATION SERVES NO PURPOSE. YOU DO NOT SPEAK ON BEHALF OF EARTH.

#(FURTHER_QUESTIONS)
DO YOU HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS EARTHLING?

#(no_more_questions)
No, that's all.
