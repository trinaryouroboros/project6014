#(SPACE_HELLO_1a)
Greetings. This is captain 

#(SPACE_HELLO_1b)
 of the Earth star cruiser Sagan.
Hello my friend! How can we help you Captain?

#(SPACE_HELLO_1c)
This is captain Tuf of the star cruiser Sagan.
How can we be of assistance my friend?

#(SPACE_HELLO_2)
Hello my friend! Glad to see you back in the neighborhood!
Anything we can help you with?

#(SPACE_HELLO_3)
This is Captain Tuf of the star cruiser Sagan. How can we assist you?

#(ask_news)
Got any hot news from this side of the galaxy?

#(keep_up_goodbye)
Keep up the good work, guys. See you later!

#(short_on_fuel)
You wouldn't happen to have any extra fuel with you? We're running pretty lean.

#(spare_nukes)
Would you have some old nukes to spare?

#(NEWS_1)
Not much, mainly patrolling the quadrant and
enjoying the stars while waiting on our next big assignment.
I never get tired of them. You couldn't see the stars under that damn slave shield.

#(NEWS_2)
Yeah. I've got a bit news for you.
We've lost contact with the starship Amelia.
HQ says they heard routine radio traffic then nothing.
No hardware warnings or distress calls were sent out.
It just vanished. Could be a malfunction, or it was attacked.
Nobody knows. HQ is sending a patrol over to investigate.

#(NEWS_3)
Yes, the patrol that was sent out after the missing cruiser
came back. It found no signs of the ship.
Some say it was an Ur-Quan Kohr-Ah surprise attack.
I'm not so sure about that. The aggressive nature of the
Kohr-Ah makes them more likely to attack with guns blazing.
They're still dangerous to come across but they still give you
plenty of time to make a distress call.
I think it was a surprise attack, perhaps using 
a cloaking device.

#(NEWS_4)
Things have been pretty quiet Captain.
We're just waiting on the details of a science assignment 
out in the Orion Nebula.


#(NEWS_5)
We've been assisting with some repairs of some nearby satellites.
Other than that, not much has happened in the past few days.

#(FUEL_1)
Sorry, captain, but the sheer volume of your Explorer ship
makes it pretty pointless to transfer from our limited reserves.

#(FUEL_2)
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but your vessel is way too 
big for our fuel to be of any real help.

#(FUEL_3)
You need to get better at math... The whole tank of this cruiser
wouldn't move that barge of yours an inch.

#(NUKES_QUESTION)
...Are you joking?

#(serious)
Not at all.

#(joking)
Just horsing around! Lighten up, buddy!

#(NUKES_SERIOUS)
Oh, you want me to just give you nuclear weapons?
Well...since you asked..
Short answer? No.
Long answer? NNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.


#(NUKES_JOKING)
Your sense of humor sucks my friend! We're still in a state of war, you know.

#(GOODBYE_CAPTAIN_1)
Until next time my friend!

#(GOODBYE_CAPTAIN_2)
Be careful out there my friend. It's still pretty hostile out there.

#(GOODBYE_CAPTAIN_3)
Take care, my friend!

#(NEUTRAL_SPACE_HELLO_1)
Friend human. You are hereby cordially invited
to a bloody duel to the death via an impromptu
exchange of nuclear missiles and SDI laser blasts.
...Interested?

#(NEUTRAL_SPACE_HELLO_2)
Greetings, traveler. I present thee two options:
You may cowardly back out of my sight this instant, or
you can be a man and pick a fight with me.
What it'll be?

#(HOSTILE_SPACE_HELLO_1)
Yo, bitch! Wanna fight?

#(HOSTILE_SPACE_HELLO_2)
Yo, yo, yo, wanna exchange a few nukes?

#(yessiree)
Yessiree! Lemme at you!

#(nonono)
No thanks, matey, some other time.

#(MADE_MY_DAY)
You really made my day, pal!

#(MADE_WOOD)
Ah. I guess some captains are made of wood these days.
