#(SPACE_HELLO_1a)
Ho! This is captain 

#(SPACE_HELLO_1b)
 of star cruiser Demosthenes.
It's our heroic liberator!
How can I help you Captain?

#(SPACE_HELLO_1c)
Greetings. This is captain Ender of the star cruiser Demosthenes.
Wow. It's you! How can I help?

#(SPACE_HELLO_2)
Ho, captain! Our hero finally returns!
Anything you need?

#(SPACE_HELLO_3)
The hero from Unzervault! 
How can we help Captain?

#(ask_news)
Got any hot news from this side of the galaxy?

#(keep_up_goodbye)
Keep up the good work, guys. See you later!

#(short_on_fuel)
You wouldn't happen to have any extra fuel with you? We're running pretty lean.

#(spare_nukes)
Would you have some old nukes to spare?

#(NEWS_1)
Not much, mainly patrolling the quadrant
and escorting trade ships in case some Kohr-Ah show up.
Personally, I wish the Alliance allocated more tasks for our fleet.
The long range of our missiles would complement the
devastating capabilities of Avatar ships nicely!

#(NEWS_2)
Everybody around here is talking!
We lost a cruiser near Tauri on an expedition to Corvi.
HQ heard the usual radio traffic and then nothing!
No distress signal, they just vanished!
Some say it's a Kohr-Ah ambush, but that's not their style.
HQ is sending somebody to investigate.

#(NEWS_3)
The patrol that was sent after the missing cruiser
found no signs of the ship.
Some say the Kohr-Ah jumped them, but that's not
their style.
You see, they still haven't changed tactics.
Full Frontal attacks, guns blazing. 
Lots of time to send a distress signal.
If you ask me, I think it was someone else
like someone with a cloaking device.

#(NEWS_4)
Things have quieted down quite a bit.
Lately we've just been sitting idle,
waiting on the details of an assignment to Gamma Serpentis I.

#(NEWS_5)
Escorting cargo ships mostly.
We've been running drills and training just to be ready.

#(FUEL_1)
I'm sorry, captain, but the sheer volume of your Explorer ship
makes it pretty pointless to transfer from our limited reserves.

#(FUEL_2)
Regrettably your vessel is way too big for our fuel to be of any real help.

#(FUEL_3)
Negative Captain. By my calculations our entire fuel tank
wouldn't be enough to move that monster ship anywhere.

#(NUKES_QUESTION)
Good one Captain! Wait, are you serious?

#(serious)
Dead serious.

#(joking)
Just horsing around! Lighten up, buddy!

#(NUKES_SERIOUS)
I'd love to help you, but the last thing I need is 
a court martial and wind up in prison being
some bad man's girlfriend.

#(NUKES_JOKING)
Phew! You had me going!
Good one Captain!

#(GOODBYE_CAPTAIN_1)
Be careful out there sir.

#(GOODBYE_CAPTAIN_2)
Goodbye Captain. Careful out there. There is no teacher but the enemy. 
No one but the enemy will tell you what the enemy is going to do.

#(GOODBYE_CAPTAIN_3)
We need you to be clever Captain. Think of solutions to problems 
we haven't seen yet. It's the only way to survive out here.

#(NEUTRAL_SPACE_HELLO_1)
Friend human. You are hereby cordially invited
to a bloody duel to the death via an impromptu
exchange of nuclear missiles and SDI laser blasts.
...Interested?

#(NEUTRAL_SPACE_HELLO_2)
Greetings, traveler. I present thee two options:
You may cowardly back out of my sight this instant, or
you can be a man and pick a fight with me.
What it'll be?

#(HOSTILE_SPACE_HELLO_1)
Yo, bitch! Wanna fight?

#(HOSTILE_SPACE_HELLO_2)
Yo, yo, yo, wanna exchange a few nukes?

#(yessiree)
Yessiree! Lemme at you!

#(nonono)
No thanks, matey, some other time.

#(MADE_MY_DAY)
You really made my day, pal!

#(MADE_WOOD)
Ah. I guess some captains are made of wood these days.
