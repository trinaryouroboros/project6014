#(SHO_GREETING1)
Greetings, Captain.

#(SHO_GREETING2)
Welcome back, Captain.

#(a_woman)
Hey, you are a female.

#(YES_WOMAN)
Astute observation, Captain. I would suggest that you withhold yourself from
sharing similar truisms in future dealings with members of alien races. 
My understanding is that the reproductive capacities of oneself
are generally considered a delicate subject.

#(condescending)
Well, that's nice. Now can you please be a dear and connect me to whomever is in charge?

#(i_luv_furries)
Hey baby. You're kind of cute for a space dog.

#(BACK_OFF_CREEP)
Captain, with a due respect
By your standards, I may be young, and I may be small
but if you try to harass me again,
I shall kick your butt so hard it will make a Glory Device look like a firecracker.

#(just_joking)
Sorry! You Shofixti can't take a joke! 

#(sorry_disrespectful)
I don't know what got into me. I apologize.

#(JUST_JOKING_REPLY)
Or perhaps your jokes need to be better.
Just in case you wanted to know...
I am Administrator Hiroku. I am in charge of this colony.

#(DISRESPECTFUL_REPLY)
Well since you did... save our civilization from extinction
Apology accepted. Allow me to introduce myself.

#(courteous_hello)
Well met, Madam. With whom do I have the pleasure?

#(INTRODUCING_HIROKU)
Captain, I am Administrator Hiroku. I am in charge of this colony.
I am sure you have many questions. I have a few moments in my schedule
to bring you up to date on pertinent matters.

#(tell_me_about_culture)
I am deeply fascinated by your culture. Can you shed light on some specifics?

#(GO_TO_CULTURE)
I would be glad to, Captain. What do you want to know?

#(how_it_works_out)
So, I've heard the Shofixti society is pretty... gender-inequal, right?

#(SINCE_YOU_MENTIONED_IT)
Well, now that you mention it
the Shofixti males still prefer flying around looking for fights
and when they find one
they just end up just blowing themselves up.
One could wonder if that is the best way settle a fight.
Meanwhile the women stay home, and run everything.
Education, manufacturing, food, all done by females.
Shofixti men are loving, noble creatures, fearsome fighters
but they are also stupid. 

#(thats_sad)
I didn't think about it that way. I understand your burden.

#(humans_are_different)
Humans are different. You should follow our example.

#(SO_DIFFERENT)
Oh, really? Tell me, where is your mate?

#(YOU_UNDERSTAND)
You do? A truly enlightened male! I'm sure your mate is with you now.

#(gf_at_home)
Actually.... she's back home on Unzervault. Taking care of our things there.

#(YOURE_JUST_AS_BAD)
...I see.

#(DIFFERENT_INDEED)
Oh yes. Different indeed.

#(surprised_seeing_female)
To be honest, I am a bit surprised to see a female in such a critical position in Shofixti society.

#(SURPRISED_ANSWER)
It saddens me but your surprise is an appropriate response. You see, Shofixti culture
has never had the chance for female suffrage to occur before it was tossed into the war.
As you are very well aware, we have returned from the brink of extinction. We cannot afford
to keep half the workforce tending to homekeeping and similar such trivialities.
We must utilize each person's potential  to survive. We need scientists, engineers, technicians
so everyone receives the best education possible tailored to his or hers capabilities.

#(history_question_1)
How have you managed to organize here on such a short timescale? And how were you selected for this post?

#(HISTORY_ANSWER_1)
As for organization
we are constantly reducing our reliance on Alliance aid, and per the severe circumstances
we are within potential success ranges in all simulations.
Captain, I beg you to forgive my lack of humility, but I am one of a selected few Shofixti
that were brought up on Chmmr prime. The Chmmr found 157 pivotal roles that, if efficiently
maintained, may increase the chances of our reaching goal of sufficient population variance
up to 2.3%. One of these roles, obviously, is the colony administrator.
I am educated in disaster scenario management, resource planning, sociology, and political science.
In your earthling terminology, I acquired 4 PhDs within the last 4 years.

#(history_question_2_admire)
Sounds like you got things covered, your race in such capable hands will strengthen the Alliance.

#(history_question_2_sarcasm)
2.3%? Guess Shofixti resurrection is one task I can wipe of my todo list.

#(HISTORY_ANSWER_2)
Captain, regardless of your opinion of my situation, we are fighting for our lives daily.
Beta Gorno I is hardly suitable for Shofixtikind to rekindle its flame.

#(history_question_3)
Why did you settle here? I saw plenty of habitable planets during the war, even, hmm... depopulated some of them.

#(HISTORY_ANSWER_3)
Captain, in order for you to understand this ridiculous choice, you must understand that
the current Shofixti population has become very religious.
We were quite a superstitious race before the war, but now it affects decision making.
We can thank this lapse of judgement mainly to the dominance
of Kishi-Bojin, my mother, third grandmother.

#(history_question_4)
Third grandmother? Are you talking about the maidens I have rescued from Zex's vaults?

#(HISTORY_ANSWER_4)
In spite all evidence, it seems you have not yet figured out Shofixti physiology.
How old am I, Captain? Or rather how old can I possibly be? 
I'll answer that for you. I am seven years old.
Captain, we are already raising our third generation. 
Under different circumstances we could replenish our
population with 10 years, probably returning to our
senseless feuds and local wars to keep our population in check.
With the number of Kishi-Bojin's supporters in a sharp rise
we might see one of those wars pretty soon.

#(enough_culture)
That's enough on your culture for now, thanks.

#(LEAVE_CULTURE)
Very well.

#(whats_going_on)
What is going on down there? Do you require assistance?

#(THIS_IS_GOING_ON)
As you must be aware, we are experiencing a severe weather event. 
Several of the new habitats were destroyed
our ongoing search and rescue effort approximate 20 casualties and 100 injured.
I kindly acknowledge your help offer but there is nothing more that can be done now.

#(THIS_IS_GOING_ON2)
We have managed to clear up most of the debris left by the storm
and repairs are underway, as you can see.
I thank you for your concern, but we will cope by ourselves.

#(tell_me_about_distress_call)
Is there any information you can give me about the lost patrol's distress call.

#(DISTRESS_CALL)
The long-range survey patrols are the best hope for us to survive as a species
and their existence is solely due to the non-fanatic faction of our government.
Alas, since I have been tasked with leading this colony
I have no further information about their success. 
I suggest contacting our scout fleet in the nearby area. 
You can find them easily enough in the nearby systems.

#(goodbye)
Ohh... look at the time! I really must be going.

#(GOODBYE_CAPTAIN)
Goodbye, Captain.
