UQMAnimationTool is written in Java using Swing, and is developed with NetBeans 7.01
The GUI is developed mainly using NetBeans' Matisse swing GUI editor. All .form files
are files saved by this editor, NetBeans will autogenerate Java code based on these
files. For this reason, I advise you to use NetBeans, rather than some other IDE like
Eclipse.

Settings are saved in  ~/.uqmtools/uqmanimationtool.properties 
 (%UserProfile%/.uqmtools/uqmanimationtool.properties on Windows)
