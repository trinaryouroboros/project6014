#(VUX_GREETING1)
UGH, get AWAY from me human. 
Just because you are free to roam the galaxy while we are imprisoned
does not mean you get to impose your hideous presence on us.

#(whats_news)
What's news?

#(DAX_INFORMATION)
Nothing you'd be interested in. 
The Chmmr are picking off the remaining Kohr-Ah one at a time
actually you might be intrigued to know that ZEX's deviant subordinate DAX
managed to escape VUX space with a squadron of Intruders before the Chmmr closed in.  
Why am I telling you this? The VUX are much better off without depraved individuals like DAX. 
At least with ZEX we had an ace commander. DAX just gives me the willies. 
Should you stumble across him in your travels, please do the right thing
and dispose of him and his weirdo henchmen.

#(how_is_slave_shield)
Hey so how's this slave shield working out for you people?

#(SPITEFUL_VUX)
You humans must know from experience how humiliating this is. 
VUX were intergalactic masters while your species were still twigging on to the industrial revolution. 
You'll excuse me if I sound a little spiteful ... it's because I am.

#(safe_under_shield)
You'll be safe under there. And at least it's blue and not red!

#(VALUE_FREEDOM)
I think we value freedom more than safety. Human, no offense intended, but you revolt me. 
We gain nothing from this disgusting conversation... Urp.

#(slave_shield_no_problem)
A slave shield didn't stop us from doing our thing if you can remember.

#(HUMAN_SUBVERSION)
Thanks for suggesting we look for ways to break free from our imprisonment. 
Maybe the Chmmr will be interested to know of this subversion. GOODBYE!

#(goodbye_vux)
Goodbye, VUX.

#(GOODBYE_EARTHLING)
Will you be on your way already...
