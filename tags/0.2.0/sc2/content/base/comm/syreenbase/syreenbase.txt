#(LUCIELLE_GREETING)
Sorry handsome, but your princess is in another castle.

#(holy_crap)
Yeah, my girlfriend used to work here and I was just... Holy Crap! I mean, uhh... Greetings. 

#(hello)
Hi there! I'm just visiting. My girlfriend used to work here.

#(am_i_lost)
Am I lost? This is the Syreen homeworld, right?

#(had_to_stop_by)
Talana asked I stop by to say "hi".

#(LUCY_SAYS_HI)
Awww. Isn't she just a sweetheart? You tell her Lucielle says "Hi".

#(i_ll_tell_her)
Alright, Lucielle. I'll tell her.

#(perfect_name)
What a lovely name.

#(minerals_here)
I've got some minerals to drop off.

#(WELCOME)
Welcome back to our home Captain! We all know about you here.
I'm just filling in since Talana left.
I suggest talking to our Syreen Commander on the planet below.

#(THANKS_SUGAR) 
Why, thank you, sugar!

#(YOU_CUTIE)
Sugar, she was right about you. You are a cutie.

#(TALK_TO_COMMANDER)
Sure is! I suggest you talk to the Syreen Commander
on the planet below for any questions. 

#(MINERALS)
We don't have many transport ships, so the minerals help. Thanks!

#(huge_fan)
BIG fan of the Syreen. Err... No, huge Fan. I mean, Syreen are awesome.

#(JEALOUS)
Well, the Syreen are big fans of you Captain. 
Frankly, the story of the handsome captain
who freed us from the Ur-Quan made many Syreen jealous of Talana.

#(not_hot)
I thought all Syreen were supposed to be hot! No offense.

#(MUCH_WOMAN)
None taken. Not everybody can handle this much woman
your loss Captain. Most Syreen are skinny.

#(must_be_going)
Well, ummm, I really must be going now.

#(COME_BACK_ANYTIME_LUCIELLE)
Come back anytime, sugar!
