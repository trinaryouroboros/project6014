#(HELLO_1)	HELLO_1.ogg
This is Slylandro scout vessel Plurious Giddiness.
We come in peace and
Oh, this is terribly exciting!
The human traveller our songs have told us so much about
is actually before us!

#(HELLO_2)	HELLO_2.ogg
How quickly we meet again!
Let us communicate a while,
ponder the mysterious nature of the universe
and the exciting vastness of space.

#(HELLO_3)	HELLO_3.ogg
The human Traveller!
Quick! Contact the other ships
so we may begin the festivities of jumbling eruptions!

#(HELLO_4)	HELLO_3.ogg
The human Traveller!
Quick! Contact the other ships
so we may begin the festivities of jumbling eruptions.

#(PANIC_HELLO_1)	PANIC_HELLO_1.ogg
Please, hear us out! We are Slylandro, gas folk
harmless inhabitants of the Source.
Don't you recognize us?

#(PANIC_HELLO_2)	PANIC_HELLO_2.ogg
Please stop attacking! We come in peace!

#(not_fooling)
You are not fooling us by disguising as friends, Kohr-ah. Prepare to die!

#(WHY_ATTACK)	WHY_ATTACK.ogg
Please! We mean you no harm.
Why is everybody attacking us?

#(close_call)
Slylandro! Boy, I almost blasted you to high heavens. Why and HOW are you in Kohr-Ah ships?

#(WONDERFUL_THING)	WONDERFUL_THING.ogg
How great! You do remember us!
Now this is a story you won't believe.
Only a few hundred rotations after the last time we met at Source
we got new visitors.
How eager they were to speak, to tell us about latest events!
How joyous and laughative they were!
But the most wonderful thing happened when a while later
they returned and brought with them these ships.
Somehow, someway, they had constructed a micro-environment
within these hulls that matched the climate of our gas giant home perfectly.
They said they wanted to offer us the opportunity
to leave our planet
explore the vast depths of space
see attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion
watch the C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate.
We were sold the very instant.
"What does it cost, though" asked Sullen Plummet and we were all
a bit worried. After all we don't have a lot to offer to
visitors from outside except our ancient knowledge on history (and clouds).
But the visitors stunned us all with their good-will. They said
"It's free of charge, har har!"

#(who_were_visitors)
Uhhuh. So who were these wonderful visitors?

#(THE_VISITORS_WERE)	THE_VISITORS_WERE.ogg
They didn't tell us that much about themselves
referring to what they called ingogneeto or something,
but this much we know:
They rode in smallish ships that
in your visual range you would call green
and they called themselves
The Benevolent Helpers.

#(pose_danger)
You are in great danger. Our enemies, the Ur-Quan Kohr-Ah ride similar ships.

#(GOOD_GUYS)	GOOD_GUYS.ogg
But the Ur-Quan were such good guys...
what?
Oh, yeah, that was the previous part. The NEW Ur-Quan of course.
But why would the Benevolent Helpers sell us ships that look
just like your enemies' ships and then
give us maps that lead right here?
They were so friendly to us.

#(up_no_good)
Those guys are up to no good. Now you better leave while you still can.

#(better_go_back)
You better leave fast. Our allies will attack those ships of yours at sight.

#(NO_GO_BACK)	NO_GO_BACK.ogg
Go back? But we cannot do that!
Not when we have got the taste of freedom
for the first time in our history.
Not when we have so many exciting new worlds
right under our gas bags so to speak.
On the other hand
We have already lost many young floaters
seen our ships being blown to bits
It's so sad
but, hey!
Couldn't you help us out?
Could you talk to your allies?
If you informed everyone of our real nature
so they wouldn't try to blow us up?
Please. This means a great deal to us.

#(your_funeral)
Ahh... It's your funeral. But I'll see what I can do.

#(THANK_YOU)	THANK_YOU.ogg
Once again, we thank you, trustworthy human Traveller!

#(ask_news_1)
Seen anything interesting in your travels?

#(GIVE_NEWS_1)	GIVE_NEWS_1.ogg
Whilst on the way to this region of space,
we encountered a large fleet of ships,
larger than we have seen ever since.
We were still very new to this kind of thing, so
we didn't know how to record data on them.
At least we know they were moving very fast
to the direction that on your map topology would be west.

#(GIVE_NEWS_2)	GIVE_NEWS_2.ogg
Everything is interesting and new to us!
But I doubt you would find our latest measurements
of the ecliptic on local gas planets very useful.

#(sorry_mistake)
Sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you. It's just so hard to tell you from enemies.

#(MISTAKE_FORGIVEN)	MISTAKE_FORGIVEN.ogg
We know you wouldn't do such a thing on purpose
You are forgiven.

#(good_bye_confused)
This is all very confusing. I think we just to go now.

#(good_bye_ok)
Goodbye, Slylandro gas bags. Be careful out there.

#(good_bye_short)
I think we have to go now.

#(GOOD_BYE_OK)	GOOD_BYE_OK.ogg
Goodbye, human Traveller!

#(GOOD_BYE_PANIC)	GOOD_BYE_PANIC.ogg
We go in peace and wish you do the same.
