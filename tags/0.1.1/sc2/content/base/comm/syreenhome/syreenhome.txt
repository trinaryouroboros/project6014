#(SYREENHOME_GREETING1)
Captain, welcome to Gaia. I am Admarelle Briella
responsible for foreign affairs
and first contact for visitors to our beautiful world.
It is our pleasure to finally invite you to our
planet surface. Make yourself comfortable.

#(SYREENHOME_GREETING2)
Again we welcome you to our Gaia, Captain.
Make yourself at home.

#(got_drink)
Great! Got anything to drink?

#(no_seats)
I don't actually see any seats...

#(thanks_for_hospitality)
Thank you for your hospitality, Briella. It's wonderful to be be here.

#(ill_stand)
Thanks, but I'll stand. This won't take long.

#(ETHANOL_FLUIDS)
Captain. We do not consume ethanol-based fluids on Gaia.
We like to remain fully conscious of and connected to our environment.
Besides, we don't usually have any problems relaxing.
What can I do for you otherwise?

#(LOTUS_POSITION)
We find the lotus position works, Captain, among others
providing you are as limber as we are.
Regardless, What can I do for you?

#(PLEASURE_OURS)
The pleasure is ours, Captain. Now, what can I do for you?

#(AS_YOU_WISH)
As you wish, Captain. What can I do for you?

#(searching_for_shofixti)
We're searching for missing Shofixti Scouts. Is there any assistance you can provide?

#(where_do_i_start)
Wow, where do I start...ahem, I mean for a start, where do I get refuelled around here?

#(thats_all)
That's all for now, Briella. Until next time.

#(NO_INFORMATION)
We do know of your quest, Captain, but there is little we can do for you
in the way of information. Our Penerator vessels are confined to our
sphere of influence for their own safety.
Space is still hostile at this time Captain.
But there are other ways we can assist.
Stop by our starbase Captain and you can refuel.

#(GIVE_VESSEL_1)
Also, we furnish you with one Penetrator vessel. Use it well.
Take care of it and you will be rewarded.

#(REFUEL_AT_STARBASE)
You can refuel at our Starbase.

#(GIVE_VESSEL_2)
Also, Captain, we present you with one Penetrator vessel.
We have trust in you that you will use it well and sparingly.
Take care of it and you will be rewarded.

#(NO_ROOM_FOR_VESSEL)
Also, we would like to present you one of our
Penetrator vessels. But it seems you don't have
sufficient space for it on your flagship. Pity.

#(TAKE_CARE)
Take care captain, please come back soon.
There is much more we can do for you here.
