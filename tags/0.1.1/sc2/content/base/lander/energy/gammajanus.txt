     ---- REPORT FROM SURFACE ----

GEOLOGIST GATZSCHMANN REPORTING, SIR. THE WEAK ENERGY READING WE PICKED UP IS EMANATING FROM AN IMPRINT ON THE PLANET SURFACE.

THE FORMATION IS DEFINITELY ARTIFICIAL. ITS SHAPE AND NEARBY TRACES OF ANTIMATTER FLUX RESIDUE SUGGEST A SPACECRAFT OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE HAS LANDED HERE AND LEFT. 

THE IMPRINT RESEMBLES 'CROP CIRCLES' THAT APPEARED IN NUMBERS ON EARTH IN 20TH AND 21ST CENTURY. 

BASED ON CZANIK-WACK ANALYSIS, THE SHIP THAT LEFT THIS MARK WAS HERE NO MORE THAN A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO.

        ---- END OF REPORT ----

BASED ON CZANIK-WACK ANALYSIS, THIS MARK IS NO MORE THAN A COUPLE OF MONTHS OLD.

IT SEEMS SOMEBODY ELSE GOT HERE BEFORE US!
