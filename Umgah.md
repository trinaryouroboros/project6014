# Umgah #

  * **Connected races:**
  * **Connected devices:**

## Summary info ##

Umgah are left to their own devices and will play no part in this mod. (Except that they were the ones that gave the Slylandro the modded Marauder ships).

We could have an Umgah scientist "device", to increase the amount of bio data harvested, and communicate with á la Talking Pet. The Umgah will send the scientist to pester you "as an act of good will" as a result of the Slylandro/Kohr-Ah scandal!
