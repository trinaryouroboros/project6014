# Lurg #

  * **Connected races:** [VUX](VUX.md), [Baul](Baul.md)

## Historical info ##

The Lurg are quintessential parasites. They don't only eat the insides of the creatures which they need to protect themselves from the harsh environment, but also control them by growing and intertwining neurophysical connections to their hosts' nervous system.

_They are the bad guys_. Absolutely ruthless and beyond compassion, they know no pity. They're the most powerful race in the rimward region of space. Their power lies in their excellence in manipulating and bending unwary victims to their will.

A long time ago they had vast territories in the far neighbourhood to the Dnyarri Empire, who they viewed as rivals -- even though the Dnyarri Empire was vastly superior in strength. They played schemes behind the curtains to undermine their foes, and they also had their role in the self-liberation of the two Ur-Quan subspecies.

Sometime after the First Doctrinal Conflict, they encountered the Ur-Quan Kzer-Za who conquered them. During the rituals of their subjugation, the Lurg told the Ur-Quan Lords how they "helped" them, with the expectation that the Lords will grant them special rights in the Hierarchy. But this revelation backfired. It was so disgusting to the Ur-Quan Lords that they immediately judged the Lurg as a major threat in the future, and decided not to grant them the option of becoming a Battle Thrall race. Instead they incinerated the Lurg homeworld.

However the Lurg survived, loathing the Kzer-Za for their rejection and the loss of their power. In the coming thousands of years, they tried to lay low and gather their strength to once again be powerful enough to start their schemes again, this time against the Ur-Quan Hierarchy.

They were undercover participants in the outbreak of the Great War, for the sake of weakening the Kzer-Za. They sped up the advance of the Kohr-Ah to bring the Second Doctrinal Conflict forward. They also assisted the Captain's effort to destroy the Sa-Matra so even if the Kohr-Ah destroy the Kzer-Za they won't have to deal with the Precursor superweapon later.

## Hiding in Shadows ##

In present day, the Lurg are involved in several conflicts around the rimward region of hyperspace, for the sake of increasing their chance of ultimate success. Examples are ...

  * They exploited a weakness in the Chenjesu-Mmrnmhrm fusion and corrupted the [Chmmr](Chmmr.md), with the intent to destroy them, however they achieved a different result. The Chmmr psyche took an unexpected change, making them paranoid tyrants. The Lurg is still able to exploit this situation, and rearranged their schemes to cause Alliance-wide confusion.
  * They secured [VUX](VUX.md) military material and personnel, hiding them away when the Chmmr was chasing them back towards Beta Luyten I, the VUX homeworld. They also rescued Sub-Commander DAX and made him their collaborator and the leader of the remaining VUX forces. DAX is now leading raids on the weaker [Syreen](Syreen.md) and [Earthling](Earthling.md) forces, in the hope that the Lurg will restore their freedom.
  * One of their agents is posing as an influential [Kohr-Ah](KohrAh.md) leader called Rath. The agent used the Rath persona to amend the Eternal Doctrine and lead a fraction of the fleeing Kohr-Ah back to Alliance space, with the intent to weaken both the NAFS and the Kohr-Ah by tying down [Chmmr](Chmmr.md) and [Yehat](Yehat.md) forces.
  * They assisted an ambitious [Baul](Baul.md) military leader (The Boss) in the subjugation of the Foon-Foon race. They traded a doomsday weapon for a Precursor device and promised more such trades in the future. The Baul would serve as easily led collaborators in the New Lurg Empire.
  * They sabotaged the Shofixti scout missions to decrease their already slim chance of survival, preventing a boost in Alliance manpower.

And of course, they try to unlock the powers of the Exotics, hiding in the threshhold of hyperspace, unreachable with normal hyperdrive. However they're unable to control them. In order to stop the Lurg the impending catastrophe, the Captain needs to assemble a number of devices that enables him to reason with the Exotics.

**LURG SPACE**

Wandering around in their SoI, the Player can make the discovery that there is nothing like a Lurg colony there. Instead most of the life supporting planets are populated with the _"Raw Prawns"_ the Lurg settled there to serve as hosts and potential starships.

**LURG PRAWN**

Being biological organisms by themselves, the Prawns were the method of hiding for the Lurg from their pursuers. Back then when they encountered their enemies, the Lurg used their hosts to pretend as harmless sub-sentient space creatures, therefore avoiding conflict and detection.

In a course of thousands of years, the Lurg have seen no need to leave their unhappy lobster hosts. In fact, they only have refined their semi-biological technology to allow them take their prawns out of their natural habitat, forcing them to live as long as possible to provide the most benefit. As the Lurg put it _"The Prawn is a lower lifeform, genetically altered... designed by us to survive in the void of space."_
