# Getting Technology #

You�ll be able to upgrade your ship at the Earthling and [Syreen](Syreen.md) Star-bases. However you still need to find the technology to do it. The technology will come from two places:

  1. [Melnorme](Melnorme.md) as in SC2 � but perhaps a more limited selection
  1. From ancient precursor finds littered throughout unknown space � probably a particular band of constellations.

## Tech retained from SC2 ##

  * Dynamos (?)
  * Hi-efficiency fuel system
  * Cargo bay
  * Crew pods

## Precursor finds ##

For one secondary melee weapons slot:

  * Ilwrath-like Cloaking Device
  * Arilou-like Teleporter
  * Earthling-like Point Defence Laser
  * Yehat-like shield

Other:

  * Powercells to upgrade firepower
  * ATS tracking device
  * Range increasing device
  * Other stuff!

And Precursor finds to upgrade your escort vessels (just like SC1):

  * Battery
  * Damage
  * Thrust

So what if you never stumble across a power cell and always have a useless pea-shooter for a weapon? Well one or more races will hint at these easter eggs. Also for some of the more essential techs, there will be more than one place where you can find them.

## Melnorme tech ##

Unfortunately your new [PrecursorShip](PrecursorShip.md) isn't compatible with the old Hellbore cannons and Shiva Furnaces etc, because the power conduits in your new ship are incompatible with the power output by BOTH regular dynamos and shivafurnaces. Due to the monocoque-design of the ship, the conduits cannot be modified without stripping the ship to atoms.

The only weapons the techs could figure out how to fit and get working as bolt-on is a self-powered Fusion blaster equivalent; It�s got a bigger punch than ion cannon, but with no extra dynamos onboard, it�s recharge rate sucks. So no dynamos can be added to the ship, and you can�t improve their battery recharge rate until you buy more tech from the Melnorme, who just happen to have compatible technology on file... ;)

Alternative that came to my mind: The ship would have immovable weapon modules installed right from the start, but only the first crappy gun would work. The guns couldn't be replaced since they're tied together with other systems onboard pretty intricately. So the player would need to buy fixes / power modules /etc. from Melnorme to get them working. Hmm.. just a thought, what do you think?

  * A hi-efficiency cargo bay module!
  * Tech to increase fire rate of main weapon
  * Some other form of Dynamo/Shiva furnace
  * New lander upgrades (either old ones again or introduce new hazards on the planets: acid rain, blizzards and shooting/exploding critters for instance.)
