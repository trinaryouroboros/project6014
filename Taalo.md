## Historical info ##

Founding members of the Sentient Milieu, the Taalo is a collective of intelligence shards forming a sub-collective (pseudo-individual) in rocklike bodies. By their definition, "Taalo" means something like "organism" and therefore anything that operates communicating with them was considered part of themselves. In a sense they viewed the Sentient Milieu as an extension of their own intelligence.

Their bodies operate by the use of their electro-magnetic manipulation powers. On a smaller scale they use this power to form larger collectives for thought and computation, on larger scale they create EM bursts that propels their body -- basically moving for them is like a joint cry of "MOVE!". Larger, more powerful individuals of Taalo can hover over ground or even fly in space like the Taalo Monolith itself. Most of them though are formed on a smaller scale that doesn't allow enough power to hover, but they are still able to roll. With time, the average Taalo body takes a spherical shape due to the attrition by rolling around.

Being the only race that had a natural immunity to Dnyarri mind control, the Dnyarri viewed them as a threat and ordered their slaves to exterminate them. They were believed to be extinct ever since.

When the Ur-Quan started finishing off Milieu members the Taalo were experimenting with Inter-Dimensional Fatigue technology. They slipped to a different dimension the [Orz](Orz.md) refer to as _"Pretty Space"_. The presence of the Taalo in _"Pretty Space"_ creates a phenomena -- a thorn in the paw of the Orz sentience -- in Orzspace similar to what Truespace gravity wells cause in Hyperspace. Through this phenomena the Taalo can be accessed.

The Taalo existence in "Pretty Space" is a rather calm one, despite the Orz' futile attempts at catching them there. The only two things they miss are the relative abundance of silicate formations in truespace and the potential to extend themselves by befriending others. They don't show signs of sorrow over this, yet still one would greatly improve their condition and do them a favor by getting them out of their current residence.

**CHMMR**

The Taalo will provide the cure to the silicon part of the Chmmr.

Once they're done, they'll return to Delta Vulpeculae II-C and co-exist with the Orz. Apparently as long as they don't cause phenomenae in Orz's _body_, the _fingers_ don't mind having them around.

**TAALO MONOLITH**

Once the Taalo returned to their home space, the Captain can visit them to receive Monolith vessels. Monoliths are large versions of Taalo, what appears as their crew are rather like integral parts of the whole ship. A Monolith is one entity, therefore there's no need for a captain and it cannot be operated by a mixed crew.

Consequentially -- like the Slylandro Drone -- the Monolith doesn't have crew as indicator for it's health. The Captain can't assign crew to his Monoliths, he has to replenish their health at the Taalo homeworld.
