# Reactor Core Power Unit #

  * **Connected races:** [VUX](VUX.md), [Mmrnmhrm](Mmrnmhrm.md)
  * **Connected Devices:**

You must locate the rogue VUX starbase, and destroy DAX and his fleet guarding the Starbase (including some [Lurg](Lurg.md) Prawns). Then you can ransack the starbase and take its reactor core to power the [MmrnmhrmMotherArk](MmrnmhrmMotherArk.md).

If the Mother Ark isn't yet found when you beat DAX, you have no reason to dismantle a perfectly functioning base, so you'll just decide to keep the starbase in place and unmodified until NAFS decides where to relocate it.

But once you have found Mother Ark, the reactor core can be removed from the starbase.
