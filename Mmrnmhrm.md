## Historical info ##

The original Mmrnmhrm were produced by a Mother Ark which travelled into the Virginis constellation about a millennium ago. They were thought to be "wilderness tamers"/pre-colonizers for some other race, and thought to only have merged with the Chenjesu to stave off extinction since the Mother Ark broke down and couldn't produce any more Mmrnmhrm since before the start of the Great War.

The source of the Mother Ark's breakdown was that her power core was damaged. The only power source big enough to power up the Mother Ark is of starbase scale, and those things take years and bazillions of RU to manufacture. To solve this problem, the Mmrnmhrm tried to set up a colony in the Beta Herculis system for exploiting the resources of the constellation before the war, but due to the Spathi protest their effort broke down before it could have started.

During the war, the Mmrnmhrm moved the Mother Ark out of harms way from Virginis and rimward, avoiding the advancing Hierarchy fleets. With the number of Mmrnmhrm drones dwindled due to war casualties, and the segregation of the majority of Mmrnmhrm by the Slave-Shield on Procyon, constructing a power core became a hopeless endeavour. It was clear the war was lost, and so the remaining free Mmrnmhrm decided to move the Mother Ark further out to some remote star system, in the hope that someday the Mmrnmhrm will be freed and she can awaken again.

## The Mother Ark ##

Information about the Ark's location can be learned from the [Slylandro](Slylandro.md).

The lander party discover that the [Power Core](PowerCore.md) of the Mother Ark needs to be replaced. The NAFS have several starbases, but understandably the Captain can't just tear out their Cores. The solution presents itself once you locate the VUX rebel DAX and his secret starbase hideout. When you've defeated DAX and his cronies you can ransack the starbase and take its power core. The other option to obtain a Core is to ally yourself with the [Baul](Baul.md) Boss and eliminate the [Foon-Foon](FoonFoon.md) Rebels, and take _theirs_ instead.

Once the Ark powers up, she and her children awake and she raises to orbit the planet and starts churning out more new X-Forms. Their SOI begins to grow. From now on you can talk to them. They're generally friendly and sympathetic, interested in the outcome of the war.

Soon after the Mother Ark downloads the memories of her children, she realises that a war was fought while she was asleep. She'll link up to the Explorer, and will notice a Mmrnmhrm component fused with an alien lifeform. Talking to the Explorer she'll become to know about the Chenjesu and "The Process", and that the Explorer is infected. Fortunately the Mother Ark is capable of fixing the Mmrnmhrm part by creating a [software vaccine](MmrnmhrmFix.md), however applying it to the Chmmr is only effective when the cure to the crystalline part is also present.

To solve the Exotics puzzle we need the assistance of an AI with a complexity superior to every known artificial intelligence. The Mother Ark herself therefore is a key ingredient. The Captain can ask for her assistance, and she's willing to help, but there's a problem: she needs to migrate into the Explorer's computers, but the Explorer doesn't have the capacity required to contain her. The solution comes when the Explorer absorbs the [Nexus](Central.md) -- a data storage device that contains the Faz VR -- the [Faz](Faz.md) gives to the Captain.

If the Central Nexus is in place, the Mother Ark AI moves into the Explorer and blends with it's original AI. This means that from now on her voice replaces that of the original AI, and she'll make a few extra remarks -- advices, observations -- when the Captain talks with other races. The Mother Ark's body becomes a hollow Starbase, capable of constructing X-Forms for the Captain.

**NOTES FOR VOICE ACTING**

The best voice effect I can think of for the Mmrnmhrm is the auto-tune voice one can hear in Saints Row 3 and Portal. Our robots _sing_ their dialogue, making them sound adorable and sympathetic. The Mother Ark has -- of course -- a female voice, while X-Form drones have high pitched male voice.

**NOTES FOR MUSIC**

Could we emulate the SID sound of Commodore 64? That would be great!
