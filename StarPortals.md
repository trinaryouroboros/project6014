# Star portals to OrzSpace #

  * **Connected races:** [Orz](Orz.md)

There's the portal from truespace to Orzspace at Alpha Vulpeculae, and there are also other portals around the galaxy in truespace locations � a bit more hassle, but wouldn�t be a complete reprise of the SC2 portal spawner.

When in Orzspace, time will change as a function of X-axle or the distance to starmap�s center! Then the portals� corresponding location in hyperspace could be a function of their location on Y-axle or the angle of the circle they are on in Orzspace.

Of course it would be necessary to have only portals leading back to the current time. This could be explained with our limited perception of time / if we need a device to move in Orzspace, the device�s limited capabilities.

This time changing aspect allows for a nice twist with [Taalo](Taalo.md): Their location in Orzspace will be at �time� when they disappeared from truespace, at around -20.000 years. You could get hints for that disappearance date and �connect the dots�. The Taalo residence could be a **nook** in Orzspace � Like entering truespace from hyperspace but weirder.

In addition to ghosts of [Androsynth](Androsynth.md) and Taalo, Orz �fingers� roam the Orzspace. These appear as huge black holes that try to catch your vessel. Once you touch �em it�s game over for you, with an ominous cutscene.

We could make it so that the fingers don't spawn in your path when you're traveling on auto pilot. That would make it safe to use auto pilot in Orzspace, and make it less frustrating and more practical to use.
