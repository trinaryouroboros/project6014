# FleeingRace #

connected Races:**[KohrAh](KohrAh.md)**

# Summary Info #

Thousands of years ago the FleeingRace saw the Kohr-Ah coming and have since been on the move, just trying to get out of the way. At first they tried to warn others, but that never worked, and just made the Kohr-Ah chase them specifically until a large group of them was caught. Since then they have avoided contact with everyone.

Since the destruction of the Sa-Matra and the end of the death march, there has been some debate over whether to settle down.

It will be possible to make them enemies, but not hard to make them friends.

# Details #

The FleeingRace, specializing in stealth, could serve somewhat the same role as the ZFP did in sc2, with scouting.

They could provide some of the earliest warnings of the Exotics, though these could be buried among a recounting of the various threats they've seen, or seem exaggerated.

Randomly appear in unoccupied systems in the SW half of the map. They are too weak to count as allies against the exotics, failing to meet them should not be game-breaking.

# Ship Thoughts #

Their ship should be somehow ideally suited to taking on Kohr-Ah but otherwise unremarkable. It should also be moderately fast, suited to their running away.

Below is a proposal for achieving this:

Not so great at turning (better than Y-form, though), faster than Kohr-Ah. 10 sec to refill its battery. 10 crew.

Main weapon is a bit like a ZFP tongue except much much longer (as long as a VUX laser, say), and only 4 points of damage, and it takes a short time to extend and contract. It blocks any shot up to and including fearballs, stun nets, and FRIED. If it hits the enemy ship, an asteroid, or the planet, gives a bit of a bump like a weak Mauler cannon. Should be able to fire these a little faster than Kohr-Ah can generate the energy for blades.

Secondary weapon is a shield that absorbs 4 points of damage before expiring, but doesn't wear off otherwise. Completely protects against planet collisions but is fully consumed. Ship enters battle with the shield active; restoring it will cost the whole battery.

If this shield is too effective against non-Kohr-Ah, the shield could have a chance of blocking a shot equal to the fraction of points of protection it has left.
