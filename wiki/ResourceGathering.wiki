= Resource Gathering =

So as with SC2 you�ll have to resort to mineral gathering to keep the RU�s flowing. 

The mineral wealth in the stars retained from SC2 will be reduced by maybe 95%, to reflect that Zelnick (you!) have already pillaged these planets, an that only trace amounts remain

And as with SC2 you�ll get bio data and sell to the [Melnorme] for their credits and there are some rainbow worlds too.
