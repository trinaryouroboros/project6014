The Taalo are trapped in OrzSpace. You can visit OrzSpace when you secure the Temporal Wrapper from the [Ariloulaleelay]. You’re able to bring back single Taalo ships with your own device, but to move a whole race back, you need something special. [Orz] perhaps have the technology – but they won't give it to you. Some other race can help you out.

The truespace Androsynth with their hi-tech skills and motivation could replicate and re-scale your Temporal Wrapper device in hope of rescuing their brethren that they suppose are trapped in Orzspace. The Arilou would never give you this kind of device for it would be very dangerous to disturb the Orz.
