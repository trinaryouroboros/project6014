 (These seem a bit throwaway and vague, as if only to serve the purpose of bringing the player terraforming plants. Perhaps get rid of these, and replace them with the Supox? I bet the Supox could help the Shofixti out. -- jorisvddonk)

  * *Connected devices:* [TerraformingPlants], [SlaveShieldBuster]

== Summary info ==

You can hear about the existence of these guys from the [Melnorme].

They had developed a sophisticated culture and reached star-faring capability on their own. But their early broadcasts into space were picked up by the [KohrAh] and Ur-Quan. After the Kohr-Ah had just about wiped them out the Ur-Quan arrived and put them under a slave shield.

Their development took a set-back under the slave shield but they still retained the technology to create terraforming "devices" (to recreate life-giving atmosphere on otherwise dead planets)... which are actually sophisticated, bio-engineered plants. You can get the plants off these guys to make a new homeworld for the Shofixti.

You can use the slave shield buster to free them. In the meantime they have been building military capability to prepare for the return of the Ur-Quan. As soon as you release them, they develop a reasonable Sphere of Influence. 

(I haven’t added these guys to the starmap yet – any idea where they could/should go?)
