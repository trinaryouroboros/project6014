== Summary info ==

Associate member of NAFS. The Spathi were permitted by the Chmmr to remain slave-shielded. However the Chmmr insisted that they erect and maintain a starbase to keep communications open. However, lately, the Spathi haven't been pulling their weight so Hayes or Chmmr send you to check out what the Spathi are up to.

When you turn up to the starbase to say �hi�, the lights are turned off and the Spathi keep pressing you for a password. You can try out different alternatives, but all of them are wrong - there is no real password. You need to exhaust the password dialogue tree to get a new alternative "TURN ON THE LIGHTS NOW, YOU MAGGOTS" or something like that.

ALTERNATIVE1: When the lights turn on you discover that they haven�t done very much and have turned the interior of the starbase into a giant fun-time area. 

ALTERNATIVE2: The Spathi on the starbase were really trying to fool the Spathi on the homeworld to switch places with them, they would do everything possible to make it SEEM like a party. This would account for why they won't turn on the lights (even for their own people).

Anyway, you set the things straight at the starbase with some selected threats.

What happens when you bust the Spathi slaveshield??
