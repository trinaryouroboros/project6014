== Historical info ==

In ancient times, the Mael-Num race was known for it's culture based on balanced exchange, which -- as they believed -- was a fundamental truth about the workings of the universe (1). They practiced equal exchange in their everyday life, and extended it to nearly anything. For instance, they couldn't participate in meaningful conversations with an empty purse. Nothing that could possibly have any value -- goods, information or services -- was given away without a price, because that would put someone in the awkward position of feeling indebted to the other. Without the mutual intent to be part of an exchange, the act of giving was generally viewed vulgar and rude (2). (To make a comparison, it was resented in the same way humans resent sexual violence.)

The Mael-Num was one of the four founding races of the Sentient Milieu, and a major influence in spreading the sense of mutuality among members. For other members they felt like rigid and insensitive, but also consistent and trustworthy (3). Their prices were always reasonable and their wares were never defective (4).

Eventually the Mael-Num became mentally enslaved by the Dnyarri, and forced to assist in the destruction of the Taalo, then later the Drall and Yuli. They were one of the former Milieu races who survived the 3000 years of Dnyarri reign, ended by the two Ur-Quan subspecies. The fall of the Dnyarri Empire brought a short-living joy. The Kzer-Za and the Kohr-Ah began exercising their respective doctrines, which gave other Milieu races slavery or death.

A few days after the Ur-Quan Kzer-Za moved in to conquer the Faz homeworld, a Faz delegation made a visit to one of the Mael-Num market stations. Surprisingly they didn't purchase anything to strengthen their defenses, but -- uncharacteristical to the unimaginative Faz -- they bought copies a single FunROM and left. Days later the Faz suddenly ceased to resist and surrendered to the Kzer-Za, and were put under a Slave-Shield. No one knows what happened to them ever since.

While the Kzer-Za finished subjugating the Faz, the Kohr-Ah was about to destroy the Yuptar. The Yuptar, instead of holding their ground, planned to escape destruction through Mael-Num territory with the Kohr-Ah on their tails. The Mael-Num also planned to escape but they needed more time, so they sold false telemetry to the Yuptar, directing them right into the arms of the Kohr-Ah. The Yuptar were destroyed without a trace, and the Kohr-Ah were slowed down, unfortunately not enough for the Mael-Num to escape safely. Were the Mael-Num not say "The Words" in the last moment -- putting the Kohr-Ah into hesitation -- the Kzer-Za wouldn't have arrived in time to create an opportunity for the Mael-Num to slip away, never to be found again.

== The Melnorme ==

The fall of the Yuptar opened up a chasm of guilt and embarassment in the Mael-Num. It wasn't the death of their comrades that touched them so deeply, but the thought that they survived by selling defective information _for full price_. The Trade Masters also figured that this incident should be kept secret, as it would jeopardise their reputation in front of their clients -- though at the time the number of their clients were rapidly declining. However in the following thousands of years they were able to rebuild their trade network underground, more influential than ever -- and even though their culture didn't change in large, their name morphed into "Melnorme".

The role of the Melnorme in the Second Doctrinal Conflict was supporting the Captain in their own way to increase the chance of his success against the Ur-Quan. Now they continue to purvey fuel, information and technologies.

*THE FUNROM BUSINESS*

The Mael-Num traded many sorts of goods in the Sentient Milieu. Among these goods, they had FunROMs in their storages for people who at the time wanted to relax instead of changing the course of history. Some of these FunROMs have a huge re-sell value, which made them remain in the market persistently ever since the formation of the Sentient Milieu.

The Melnorme continued to sell these products in small numbers, though in the Rimward region their only buyers lately were Spathi captains. Now that most of the Spathi are under their Slave-Shield, they don't keep FunROMs in stock anymore (5).

*NOTES FOR WRITING*

(1;3) the Taalo could speak about these aspects

(2) This is some info we may have encountered in UQM already, but it's worth mentioning as part of another round in debating about altruism -- if the player chooses to engage in that.

(4) something the Melnorme will tell us after we reveal their past identity.

(5) The Captain can try to pre-order FunROMs, only to lose a few credits and be informed that he can acquire his copy in 5 years ...
