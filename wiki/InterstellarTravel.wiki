= Interstellar Travel =

Quasispace portals are sealed off. Instead, rapid transit can be achieved by travelling through Orzspace. Orzspace is accessed via portals in truespace star systems. You need [TemporalWrapper] device (from [Ariloulaleelay]) to stay alive in Orzspace. It's a dangerous place...

In addition to ghosts of [Androsynth] and [Taalo], [Orz] “fingers” roam the Orzspace. These appear as huge black holes that try to catch your vessel. Once you touch ‘em it’s game over for you, with an ominous cutscene.
