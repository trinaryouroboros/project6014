Umgah are left to their own devices and will play no part in this mod. (Except that they were the ones that gave the Slylandro the modded Marauder ships).

If we want to, we could have an Umgah scientist as a "device", to increase the amount of bio data harvested. It could be a communicable guy like talking pet was. OR we could make it an Umgah related biological device to have the same effect (except dialogue).
