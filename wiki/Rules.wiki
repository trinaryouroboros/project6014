= Introduction =

This page lists some project development rules.

= Spoilers =

Since this game is heavily story-based, we need to make an effort to avoid spoiling it for potential players.  Please try to avoid discussing development in public and without spoiler warnings.


= Plot development =

This needs to be coordinated by a single person.  That person is currently Cedric.


= Version control =

Traditional Subversion editing guidelines apply:

  * Useful log messages for all commits, written as imperative sentences, e.g. "Add Vux slave shield."
  * Branches for large or experimental pieces of work.
  * When copying, moving or renaming files, try to use Subversion commands to maintain history.
  * Don't check in large, easily generated or irrelevant content.
