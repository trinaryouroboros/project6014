  * *Connected races:* [Melnorme], [Mmrnmhrm]
  * *Connected devices:* [SlaveShieldBuster]

== Summary info ==

A race from the old Sentient Melieu. They were slave-shielded 20,000 years ago by the [UrQuan] and have been so ever since. With the Slave shield buster you can free them. The Faz can reveal secrets about the sentient milieu, including the origins of the [Melnorme]. For some reason the Melnorme will be desperate to keep these secrets hidden. Perhaps the Melnorme played some role in assisting the Dnyarri to over-power the Milieuï¿½s other members. Or caused the Milieu's downfall by escaping instead of fighting. The Melnorme feel a bit bad about this. The Faz will be good guys.
