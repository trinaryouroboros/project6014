  * *Connected devices:* [SlaveShieldBuster]

== Summary info ==

A race from the old Sentient Melieu. They were slave-shielded by the Ur-Quan and have been so ever since. With the Slave shield buster you can free them.

The Faz dwell in a global virtual reality by the time the Captain encounter them. They are being kept, grown and nourished in stasis pods, waiting for somebody to crack their slave-shield and wake them up. For 20000 years nobody attempted to free them, and the consciousness of new generations blended with the VR. Artificial experiences became real to them. They don't even know who they were.

The Captain must wake them up and convince them of their true identity.
