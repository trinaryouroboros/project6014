== Historical Info ==

A race from the old Sentient Milieu. They evolved on a world where most predators developed methods to deceive their prey. In their prime they were highly fond of empirical truth, and made other Milieu members think they have a genetically inherent need for proof before they believe anything. Some may say even their religions were not faith based. They also liked to travel in space: it was part of their life for thousands of years!

After the fall of the Dnyarri Empire, the Faz were the first to fall to the Ur-Quan Kzer-Za Path of Now and Forever. As part of their subjugation, they were slave-shielded by the Ur-Quan and a starbase was erected in orbit of their homeworld. They didn't want to lose space travel completely, so they bought a space adventure FunROM from the Mael-Num, even though virtual entertainment -- digital illusions deceptive by design -- or mere fantasizing were not their thing. Being loyal friends to their Milieu allies for centuries, a little self-delusion was still better than taking part in their fall as Battle Thralls.

As time passed, they expanded the Mael-Num FunROM to a global network, which eventually turned into global virtual reality.

As of now, the whole Faz race is being kept, grown and nourished in stasis pods, waiting for somebody to crack their slave-shield and wake them up. For 20000 years nobody attempted to free them, and the consciousness of new generations blended with the VR. Artificial experiences became real to them. They don't even know who they were.

== The VR ==

By the time the Captain arrives at the Faz homeworld, the Slave-Shield is still up. Obviously to make any contact with the surface that shield has to be busted. The surface is quilted with dark towers while maintenance drones and feral lifeforms roam around. Examining the dark towers the lander crew can inform the Captain that the towers are seemingly buildt inside out and there's no way to enter them. The crew also discovers the existence of a carrier wave designed to estabilish connection between the VR matrix and outsiders -- in case someone non-Hierarchy manages to lift the shield and free the Faz. The player needs to find the exact tower that emits the carrier wave, and from there on he can engage communication with the Faz only with the assistance of a lander down on the surface. (Requires 1 fuel to land so it's slightly costly)

When contacted, the system chooses an individual for the role of manual confirmation. This is the Faz we'll speak with, however this is where the 20000 years take their toll.

==The Philosopher==

Though the Faz chosen to communicate with the Captain is the only one capable of waking up the rest of the population and start the rehabilitation protocols, he is unfortunately not aware of his intended role. He awakened to the Captain's call merely because he was closest to the virtual representation of the VR's communication algorythms. This representation appears to be a unique object, one that is bound to a virtual space station. History turned this object into a relic of legend, with it's purpose forgotten by all the inhabitants of the VR and neglected by most, save a group of philosophers, one of which is locked in to accompany the relic in solitary meditation.

The Philosopher is a doubter. Even though the reality and limited, unchanging nature of his universe is proven true every way possible, and his race seems to reached the end of knowledge, he still believes that all is merely a deception (1). This idea drilled itself deep into his mind, so as he talks he might make the impression that he reached the edge of sanity (2).

*THE MELNORME FUNROM*

The Captain must convince the Philosopher of the true identity of him and his race. To do this, the Captain needs to obtain one of Fwiffo's _Melnorme FunROMs_, a video game with a history originated from ancient Mael-Num times. Even after 20000 years, the game operates on the same fundamental code, which contains a flaw that makes the game somewhat predictable, as it is pointed out by Fwiffo and the Melnorme. To convince the Philosopher about his world being an artificial construct, the Captain needs to find out which of Fwiffo's five FunROMs resemble the VR world, then demonstrate this flaw by predicting some events in it.

*NOTES FOR WRITING*

(1) The conversation could be socratic/cartesian in nature, but the Captain is by all means -- even if sometimes nerdy -- a simple dude. Sort of Guybrush Threepwood in space. If the player doesn't want to hear a lengthy philosophical babbling, he should be provided with a quick bypass.

(2) To pronounce the Philosopher's craziness and make him the source of a awkward-dark atmosphere, our philosopher's dialogue may have a poetic flavor, with dramatic monologues.

*NOTES FOR SOUND EDITING*

The Faz is encased in a Capsule and wears breathing apparatus, which suggests a Vader-ish tube voice.

* IN THE FUTURE *

In hopeful future episodes in the P6014 timeline, the Faz could undergo a step-by-step rehabilitation procedure, changing their screen art in every episode. Their actual role in those episodes is unclear yet.
