= Tips for writers =

Building a game storyline is not easy. Writing a story collectively is much harder than writing it alone. But it is also wonderful because of the amazing creativity we can have when we truly build on each other's idea. This quick guide may provide insights on how to help us build a rich and memorable story, and do it successfully together. 

=== Avoid simplistic 'good' vs 'evil' mindset ===
Good stories are not black and white, they are grey. Try to think of ideas (events, aliens, situations) that cannot be seen as "good" or "bad".  The player needs dilemmas, difficult decisions, ethically unclear situations, etc.
If an alien race looks particularly evil, ask yourself: is there a way to make them less "simple"? For example, in SC2, the Kohr-Ah were killing all sentient life in the galaxy - but they also spent 20,000 years suffering in pain and agony at the mercy of the Dynarri. Understanding them is not as simple as saying "they are Evil". Another problem with over-simplistic plots is that the player may see right through it. 

=== Think in layers ===
Good long-term stories are built like an onion: in layers. From the player's perspective, good plot elements get discovered little by little. And each new layer of the story should ideally cause the player to think "Wait a minute!!!" and have to re-assess all his previous knowledge. Hence, plots where a seemingly evil race later turns out to have been manipulated (like the Umgah with the talking pet in SC2) add depth and interest to a story.

=== Keep all the races open till the very end ===
Let's assume all races from the original game may at some point still be used. If a races died, keep in mind they probably aren't fully extinct, unless the story specifically calls for this (and even there.. the galaxy is wide... the Shofixti were also believed to be extinct and look at them?)

=== Keep all your options open ===
To help us build a richer story, try to keep all your options open. When deciding on a possible plotline, make sure you create two new mystery for the player for each problem he solves. Each [SC2Mysteries mystery] is a possible anchor for a future plotline, so keeping a lot of them handy makes t he writing process much easier.
In summary, no mission should ever feel totally finished and all loose end totally tied unless we are at the end of the story creation. Closing loose ends prematurely kills the creative process.

=== Writing conversations comes last ===
Although it may sound counter-intuitive, the creative process of writing a rich and compelling game story does not start with writing conversations: it must start first with building the background and the events happening in the galaxy. For example, writing Fuiffo's conversations in SC2 would have been near impossible unless a whole story was first written about what Life on Spathuwa was like and how Spathis are born, and how coward they are, etc.
So the main task right now is to build a detailed background for galaxy events, history, and races.  The conversations themselves will become very easy (and fun!) to write once these tasks are done.

=== Let go of your ego ===
Nothing can ruin collective work like a writer's ego. If we are afraid our idea MUST stay in the plot, we start blocking the creative process rather than truly thinking openly and creatively. During the creative process, brainstorm must flow. Good writers will know that letting go of their ideas is as important as bringing more new ideas.
On the flip side, brainstorming new ideas also requires each idea to be fully examined and discussed. If you think the idea is crap, then set aside your doubts for a while and think how we could build using this idea. Does this concept opens new ways of thinking? New tracks? Can it be combined with a previous idea? Can a part of it be used somewhere else? 

=== Think back from the desired outcome ===
Sometimes it's more useful to think of a storyline from the desired final outcome. For example, in SC2, the story writers may have decided: "The galaxy will be cleansed by a powerful warrior race determined to kill all sentient life". Ok, so how do we GET there and WHY? And the creative process can then proceed from that desired outcome and move backward.

=== Avoid direct linear solutions ===
Interesting missions cannot be solved with a simple solution. Good story lines requires multiple aliens, multiple devices, etc.
In addition, it should feel like a tree branching off in different direction, rather than being linear. For example, in SC2, we need the Utwig bomb. That bomb can be obtained if you have the Utwig. Getting the Utwig requires you to get 3 separate items to repair the Ultron. Each item becomes its own sub mission, involving befriending the Traddash, for instance. The Pkunk were about to move and reunite with the [Yehat]. To save the Pkonk from destruction you needed to trigger a revolution within the [Yehat], which required to revive the Shofixti, which required to perform a mission for the Vux. Good plotlines spans across multiple sub missions, and these should be inter-related to other missions in other plotlines. Think complex!

=== New races must be designed carefully ===
Any new races in P6014 must have a background story that explains why they were not present in the first episode in the original game. How did they arrive in our Galaxy? When? Why? If they were present already, why didn't we find them before? Can we link this new race to some of the previous history [SC2Mysteries hinted] or mentioned in a conversation in the previous SC2?
