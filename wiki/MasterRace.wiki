(We need new name for these guys ASAP!)

  * *Connected races:* Foon-foon aka[SlaveRace]
  * *Connected devices:*

== Summary info ==

These guys will be very friendly and enthusiastic. Will want to join the NAFS. On closer inspection it�s clear that actually these guys have been dominating another race for their own benefit. A sub-plot will be to emancipate Foon-foon from Baul�s control.

 (This reminds me (a bit) of Larry Niven's "Known Space" universe. Specifically, the Thrintun/Slavers (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrint) and the Tnuctipun that they controlled (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tnuctip) -- jorisvddonk)

You can also choose to be evil and ally with Baul to crush Foon-foon's rebellion.

You can also choose to be REALLY evil and back both Baul and foon-foon, ensuring the destruction of both. You gain a lot in short term (lot of RU, get to loot the dead planets), but will pay dearly in the end.

If you kill both, at least you have less allies in the end to kill the [Exotics] properly. Or you get some other penalty like from selling slaves to the Druuge in SC2.

If Baul join the NAFS, they could study the slave shield tech (like the Spathi did) and replicate it on the Foon-foon's homeworld, locking them in there. You could question it, and they'd retort, "but the NAFS shielded the [VUX] and Mycon?!? Why can't we shield these pesky [Foon-foon] people?"

You will need certain amount of allies to win the game. Killing both Baul and foon-foon won�t yet prevent you from winning the game, but add losing VUX, not gaining [Faz] alliance, [Shofixti] suiciding etc. and you�re running thin.
