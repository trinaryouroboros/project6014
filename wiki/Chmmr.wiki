== Summary info ==

Core member and leader of the New Alliance of Free Stars (NAFS).

The hybridisation of the two races was not complete due to premature interference by Zelnick's (your) [SunDevice] in Star Control II. They kind of work properly, they're doing a great job of hunting down [KohrAh]. However they seem to not quite have developed the knack for race-relations. They have slave shielded VUX and [Mycon] due to them being categorised as bad guys.

The Chmmr are efficient, but at the cost of their "humanity": they're domineering and paranoid in their need to control all the NAFS races. In effect they've almost become the new [UrQuan].

As you pilot around the galaxy speaking to various races the Chmmr become suspicious that you're undermining them (which you are) and stop giving you resources. As the game develops the Chmmr actively try and disrupt your activities, and may try to incarcerate you at some point.

 (How is the player actively undermining the Chmmr? Is this referring to the gossip and such? If so, make sure there's some missions/tasks where the player *IS* actively undermining the Chmmr. -- jorisvddonk)

While this is happening, random glitches and lapses start appearing in Chmmr dialogue. These oddities get more and more regular when time passes. The Chmmr also might randomly start aborting conversations / running away / attacking you. Finally, after some months, they crash completely. Their ships will stay as dead hulls in space, and Procyon starbase cannot be used anymore - there are just broken Chmmr bodies there.

Due to their mechanical nature, the Chmmr are not dead. They may be fixed.  You need to find a fix for both the Mmrnmhrm part and the [Chenjesu] part of the Chmmr and a means of delivering these fixes to all the Chmmr individuals . These fixes can be found at [MmrnmhrmMotherArk] and the Taalo who reside in Orzspace.

 (Why would the player fix the Chmmr when they were trying to incarcerate the player and his ship? Provide a good reason why the player would do this, and attempt to make it clear to him (other aliens asking the player to *please* fix the Chmmr for some reason or another?) -- jorisvddonk)

The Chmmr have slave shield busting technology. It can be retrieved from a secret stash once the Chmmr have gone comatose.
 
 (If the slave shield busting tech is required, make sure that the player *has to* grab it. -- jorisvddonk)

Also, the good old Sun Device is in another secret Chmmr device stash. Or it SHOULD be; it's actually located at DAX's starbase.

== Detailed info ==

The Chmmr started out quite ok, but have been slowly changing: they have retained little else from the Chenjesu personality except a superiority complex. All the while they're reverting more and more to narrow-mindedness of poorly designed robots.

The reason for the Chmmr degenerating comes from the Sun Device: The Chenjesu sustained damage to their equivalent of DNA in the sudden burst of energy. This damage introduces nano/femtolevel faults and cracks in the crystaline structure of the Chmmr, and these faults keep growing and increasing over time. The "biology" of the Chmmr is such that it tries to circumvent the damage by re-routing more and more functionality via the Mmrnmhrm part of the Chmmr individual. At this point the performance of a Chmmr individual is already severely impaired. They might start acting erratically. Turn crazy. Eventually the strain is too much for the mechanics; The Mmrnmhrm part burns out, which finally kills the Chmmr.

*Q:* Ok, the Chmmr must have the equivalent of doctors so why don't they notice anything/do anything?

*A:* They have noticed this but are incapable of curing the problem. Then, like a mentally unstable person, the Chmmr want to keep the problem hidden. They are already acting paranoidically - they do not wish to relinquish their seat of power, which they might have to do if their illness was found out.

=== Mmrnmrhm fix ===

You must find and fix/activate the Mmrnmhrm Mother Ark and its escorting Mmrnmhrm ships. You can bring a Chmmr ship/individual to the Mother Ark for analyzing. The sophisticated machinery of the Ark can discover problems in both the Chenjesu and Mmrnmhrm parts.

The Mmrnmhrm part fixes are then produced by the Ark. The Mmrnmhrm ships then travel to the Chmmr sphere of influence, find individual Chmmrs and replace the damaged parts.

The Mmrnmhrm do warn however that without a proper fix for the Chenjesu part, the Chmmr will burn out in a matter of months and the Chmmr will be dead all over again. So the Mmrnmhrm won't go on the rescue mission before you have the fix for the Chenjesu part.

=== Chenjesu fix ===

The Taalo have this. It is a solution of nanites, which is either:

# The equivalent of blood of the Taalo. Since the Taalo and Chenjesu both are silicon-based rock-like/crystalline beings, the self-replicating crystalline nanite "cells" are capable of fixing the minute faults inside the Taalo bodies, and incidentally, also Chenjesu crystals.
# A medicine the Taalo have developed whilst trapped inside the Orzspace. They have lived there for a loooooong time because of the funny way time acts there and have had a lot of opportunities to develop stuff.

Anyway, the Taalo could give the fix to you upon delivering a comatose Chmmr to them - it would not be required to save the Taalo from Orzspace beforehand (that would tie too many plots yarns into one and the game would become too linear.)
