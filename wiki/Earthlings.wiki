== Summary info ==

Core member of the NAFS. When your relationship with the Chmmr breaks down, Earth and its Star-base continues to support you.

However, their support does not come easy â€“ after all, they're somewhat controlled by the Chmmr. There will be a series of conversations where it becomes more and more clear that they either have to break contact with you, or with the Chmmr. The drama between the player and Hayes will be amazing. ;)
