|| Linux executable || platform specific || || ||

If you are on Windows, you want to get the main content and the windows executable.  
Once you have the necessary files, you can unzip them into a single directory.  This directory should then contain:

   * a content subdirectory
   * an executable (type depending on your platform)

You can run the game by running the executable.

for OSX, both the executable and the content are in the one package. We'll probably split these soon.

The linux exe is not there at present, but should be within 24 hours.
