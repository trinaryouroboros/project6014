== Project 6014 demo ==

_To be released 30 September 2010!_


The files are:

|| *File* || *Type* || *Size* || *Download* ||
|| Main content || required || || ||
|| Voice content || optional || || ||
|| Windows executable || platform specific || ||http://code.google.com/p/project6014/downloads/detail?name=p6014-demo-alpha-win.zip&can=1&q= ||
|| OSX executable || platform specific || ||p6014-demo-alpha-OSX10.6-app.zip  ||
|| Linux executable || platform specific || || ||

For example, if you are on Windows, you want to get the main content and the windows executable.  The voice content is optional -- without it you get the alien subtitles only.

Once you have the necessary files, you can unzip them into a single directory.  This directory should then contain:

   * a content subdirectory
   * an executable (type depending on your platform)

You can run the game by running the executable.
