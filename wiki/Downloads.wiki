For Windows and Linux, just download the installer. That file will download the content for you.

For OSX, you'll need to download the .exe and the three content packages.

You can run the game by running the executable. Windows Users may need to run the included .BAT file.

Do post to the forums if you have any issues with installation or running the game.
