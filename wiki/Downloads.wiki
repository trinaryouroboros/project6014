*Windows*
  * Just download the installer. That file will download the content for you.
  * If running the .exe directly doesn't work, you need to run the included .BAT file.

*Linux*
  * Download and install the packages tailored to the distribution you're using. 
  * If there are no packages for your Linux distribution, download the source files, compile your own version of the game (./build.sh uqm config, ./build.sh uqm) and then place the 'base content' .uqm file in content/packages. If you want hires content or any of the other addon packages, download the required .uqm files and place them in content/addons

*OS X* 
  * Download the OS X Application and the Base content package. (Other packages are optional.)
  * Follow the instructions inside the Application to install the packages.
