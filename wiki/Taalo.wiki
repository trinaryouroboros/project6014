== Historical info ==

Founding members of the Sentient Milieu. Being the only race that had a natural immunity to Dnyarri mind control, the Dnyarri viewed them as a threat and ordered their Ur-Quan slaves to exterminate them. They were believed to be extinct ever since.

When the Ur-Quan started finishing off Milieu members the Taalo were experimenting with Inter-Dimensional Fatigue technology. They slipped to a different dimension the [Orz] refer to as _"Pretty Space"_. The presence of the Taalo in _"Pretty Space"_ creates a phenomena -- a thorn in the paw of the Orz sentience -- in Orzspace similar to what Truespace gravity wells cause in Hyperspace. Through this phenomena the Taalo can be accessed.

_... More Coming Soon ..._

The Taalo will provide the cure to the silicon part of the Chmmr. For this they need to be set free from their current residence, back to truespace where various silicates can be found.

Once they're done, they'll return to Delta Vulpeculae II-C and co-exist with the Orz. Apparently as long as they don't cause phenomenae in Orz's _body_, the _fingers_ don't mind having them around.

*TAALO MONOLITH*

Once the Taalo returned to their home space, the Captain can visit them to receive Monolith vessels. Monoliths are large versions of Taalo, what appears as their crew are rather like integral parts of the whole ship. A Monolith is one entity, therefore there's no need for a captain and it cannot be operated by a mixed crew.

Consequentially -- like the Slylandro Drone -- the Monolith doesn't have crew as indicator for it's health. The Captain can't assign crew to his Monoliths, he has to replenish their health at the Taalo homeworld.
