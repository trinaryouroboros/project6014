== Summary info ==

Associate members of the NAFS, but they�ve disappeared so they are of no use to anyone it seems. The Arilou have closed down the naturally occurring QuasiSpace portal near Columbae.

The new QS portal can be discovered by talking to [Melnorme]. Upon going to QS you see there are no portals anymore, just Arilou homeworld. Another surprise if you were counting on finding the means of rapid transit.

The Arilou are not pleased that you continue to fraternise with the Orz. They suspect that the gravity anomalies of truespace are Orz related (they�re wrong; these are actually caused by the [Exotics]).

When trying to enter the Orzspace portal at Alpha Vulpeculae for the first time, Arilou stand guard and try to talk you out of it. If you try to force your way, the Arilou teleport you to safety via a temporary QS portal without asking. The next time you visit Arilou homeworld, they will (reluctantly) provide you tech to access OrzSpace if you press the matter, since they know now you�re serious about going there. And they can�t be babysitting you forever. OrzSpace can then be used for fast travel.

 (This seems a bit weak. First, they prevent you from entering, and then they change their minds and give you the tech required to pass through? How about there is no tech required to pass through (as with QuasiSpace), and the player can decide wether or not to destroy the Arilou guarding the portal, potentially breaking good relations with the Arilou for the advantages that Orzspace gives you. -- jorisvddonk 2:31 AM May 14, 2011)

== Detailed info ==

Why the Arilou have sealed off their QS portals is twofold: The motivation they give YOU is that they wish to shield [Earthlings] from the mysterious �Them� (the entity known as the Orz). They only give cryptic clues about �Them� and won�t explain it in detail.

Whilst the first reason might well be true, it�s only part of the truth: The Arilou are most interested in their own, secret agendas and don�t want others to see too much. Now that the [UrQuan] menace is over, there is no reason why they should let you come and go into QS as you please.

Whatever the hidden agendas of Arilou are, they won�t reveal them. They sure seem like they want to keep humankind safe. But for what purpose?
