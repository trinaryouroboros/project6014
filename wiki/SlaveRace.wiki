== Summary info ==

Under the yoke of (Baul). Almost their entire Sphere of Influence is consumed by that of the Baul�s - almost. One star will serve as a base for a rebellion which you can instigate. If you choose to help the foon-foon, you gain their alliance, but the Baul allies with the [Lurg].

If you deal arms to both the Baul AND the Foon-foon you gain a lot of RU, the destruction of both species, and quite a nasty reputation.

It could be that the Foon-foon manufacture a lot of the Baul's industrial goods, and so if you free them, they could lower the prices of all stuff / provide constant source of RU.

 (See my comment about Larry Niven's "Known Space" universe above at the Baul description. -- jorisvddonk)

Foon-foon COULD find a bomb that�s one of the Exotics' megaweapons (that somehow didn't go off as planned). So it would be more plausible that they're kinda equal in their fight against the Baul when it ensues. Also that would be a nice subplot, having to talk them out of using it. Maybe having them deliver it to you, the "peace-mediator". You can opt to use it on either of the races if you so choose...

This megaweapon could be used to attain the "alternative good ending" of the game IF we implement two possible good endings.

I had an idea that's been bugging me (Drachefly).

It would be that in the distant past, the Foon-foon enslaved the Baul, and were overthrown (perhaps this experience led to their current pacifism). The Foon-foon are exceedingly honorable. Once defeated, they accepted their enslavement for a fixed period which they deemed fair. The rebellion started up the next morning.
