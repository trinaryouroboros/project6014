#summary List of hints and unresolved questions from the original game

= SC2 Story Hints and Mysteries =

The original Star Control 2 game remains in our memory, above all, because if its outstanding and complex story, spanning over 20,000 years of history.

Through conversations, the player discovered the richness of the underlying plot, but many aspects raised during the original game remains shrouded in mystery.

This is excellent because it provides storytellers a good starting point for new plot lines and background history. This page is a repository of each and every rumor, hint, story or mystery raised by the original SC2 story and that we may, or may not decide to use to build additional story.

To help us compile an exhaustive list of these hints, you can use the [http://uqm.stack.nl/diff/arilou.html UQM conversation document] to track every dialogue from the original game.

== The list of mysteries ==

 * What is the Arilou's secret interest in Human beings (other than changing our *smell* to protect us from IDF beings)?
 * Are Orz the only IDF beings the Arilou were afraid / were hinting about?
 * Where did the Androsynth disapeared? (some of that possible plot line has been well developed so far, from what I have seen)
 * Is there a black spathi squadron?
 * Where do the Ur-Quan and Kohr-Ah come from? (They don't seem to have any homeworld in this galaxy, Hayes says they appeared at Ophiuchi constellation at first)
 * Why did Mycon joined the UrQuan voluntarily?
 * What happened to the Mrmrmr Mother-Ark and why was the Mother Ark never repaired (that plot line is nicely being exploited with the current story, nice stuff)
 * Where does the Sa-Matra come from?
 * Who are the Precusors?
 * Why did the Precusor left over less than a decade?
 * What are the rainbow world? (I have read some interesting ideas about this vs the Orb in the current plot)
 * If the Mrmrmr is a fully automated robotic race, are they "preparing" the galaxy for the colonisation of their real owners? (hinted by commander Hayes)
 * Umgah and Arilou have a relationship for a long time. What was their common history?
 * Androsynth hates us because our grandparents kept them as slaves of humans for 50 years (according to Hayes). What's that all about?!?
 * The Arilou hinted they had "some fun" with the Traddash before. What happened?
 * What happened to the precursor starbase hinted to be on Alpha Centauri?
 * Pkunk hinted Illwrath used to be very "good, shiny beings of light"
 * What was hidden deep under the ice cap in Antarctica and that was targeted by the Ur-Quan when they enslaved Earth? Same for Atlantis in the south eastern Atlantic ocean?
