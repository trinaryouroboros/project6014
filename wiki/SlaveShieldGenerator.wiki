= Slave-Shield Generator =

== Description ==

A piece of Ur-Quan Kzer-Za technology. It creates a self-sustaining forcefield around a planet impenetrable by physical objects.

This device is in possession of the Chmmr and the Spathi, but only the Spathi will share it if the Captain promises never to contact them again.

This device is used to restore the Xen-Weyi Slave-Shield, along with their planet's economy -- if the player wants to avoid confrontation with the Xen-Weyi and to end the game with a clear conscience.
