== Historical info ==

Decades before the Great War, the Shofixti race was uplifted and adopted by the Yehat, a warrior culture who admired their courage and sense of honor.

The Shofixti is a race of meta-marsupials with an exceptionally short gestation period, and the ability of fast reproduction. They are also unaffected by inbreeding, and never cease to be fertile.

One could rightfully ask: how did they survive without operpopulating their homeworld and depleting it's resources before they were uplifted by the Yehat? The answer lies both in their physiology and their history. The drawback of their fast maturation rate is that they live very short, yet unproportionately long: a perfectly healthy Shofixti can live about 30-35 years, though the medieval circumstances, warfare and the lack of advanced medicine by that time never allowed them to live such methuselah age. The other biological trait they have is the radically unbalanced birthrate of males and females. Out of 20 Shofixti newborns only 1 is female. Still, females can give birth to hundreds of Shofixti in their lifetime, which turned out to be a defining aspect in their history.

For centuries, the Shofixti homeworld Kyabetsu -- Delta Gorno I -- was separated into small fiefs ruled by warlords, who aspired for expanding their influence when they were not already occupied with starvation, plagues and occasional peasant revolts. For these warlords the most effective way to manage their domain was to take control of breeding by secluding females and turning procreation into a privilege given to males. In times of war, new babies were needed as warriors while peasants starved to death. In times of peace, new babies were needed as farmers to harvest the food necessary in times of war. Shofixti history rolled on by this generic cycle, and as culture advanced with the passage of centuries, the techniques of new generations of warlords became more and more refined. By controlling mating, they buildt up a social system where only the most worthy of warriors/officials/farmers were rewarded to have children of their own -- believing that the essence of exceptional subjects is inherited by their descendants, keeping the dynasty strong. Females were considered valuable items, with no freedom to choose their fate.

The Yehat gave technology and cultural definition to the Shofixti, and started a chain of events to unite all warlords under one flag, but until the arrival of the Ur-Quan the initiative lacked incentive strong enough to make the warlords forget centuries of feudal conflict. However when the Yehat joined the Alliance, the Shofixti did the same, with the leadership of the first _Grand Shogun_. The war against the Hierarchy was fought in proportions unknown to the Shofixti. Thousands of warriors met their honorable fate on the battlefield, increasing the need to produce replacements in larger numbers than ever -- inevitably turning females into breeding machines. Males became increasingly preoccupied with the glory of war, and -- with the new and effective farming techniques the Yehat brought -- left the burden of anything else on females.

The Shofixti fought valiantly, even when the Yehat withdrew from the war, leaving them no choice but to make the ultimate sacrifice. With the full approval of the lesser warlords, the Grand Shogun ordered the use of a Precursor Bomb -- a gift from the Yehat -- on the Delta Gorno star, incinerating the inner worlds of the system with all it's inhabitants and a significant portion of the invading Hierarchy ships.

From that point on, the Shofixti race was considered extinct, except one particular Shofixti warrior, who -- with the help of the Captain -- was able to resurrect his people. In months, the reborn Shofixti were aiding the _New Alliance of Free Stars_ with higher numbers of trained crewmen to defeat the Ur-Quan. After their victory, the Shofixti had to realise that there is no home left for them, and they can't remain on Earth's Starbase forever. Options for relocation were plenty, however they didn't settle far from the Gorno constellation. The primary reason behind this was due to the superstitions of males: the Shofixti inherited and still believed in the ancestor worship of the Yehat. The new Shoguns -- who were also the spiritual leaders of their families -- refused the thought to resettle on worlds where "alien spirits are dwelling". The Thraddash, Ilwrath and Burvixese worlds were practically graveyards -- not to mention irradiated. The Yehat-Pkunk Queen offered the Pkunk homeworld to the Shofixti, and the Shoguns indeed went there to inspect the planet, but came back claiming that the place has "odd spiritual essence". They also feared that _Daikon_ -- a legendary hero of Shofixti myth -- would be dissatisfied when he returns, and finds out that the world all Shofixti is supposed to protect is no longer guarded (1).

==Tanaka==

Dead. He died in heart attack years ago while still repopulating his race, with a smile on his face (2).

==Hiruko==

Hiruko is a Shofixti female who is charged with managing the settlement and the rebuilding efforts on Kyabetsu. Her work requires her not to belong to any of the dynasties, otherwise other dynasties could accuse her of representing her family instead of the entire race. Because of her position as an independent female, she don't have any value as a mother, and therefore forbidden to carry babies. Nevertheless she is respected by males, and only responds to the Shoguns.

Because of the various ways Shofixti society restricts female freedom, Hiruko -- being versed in various alien cultures -- tends to despise males generally and views history through such a lens.

Hiruko's task is seemingly impossible to accomplish. She has to build up Shofixti civilization again, but that requires none less than the revival of Kyabetsu's ecosystem, while in the meantime her race is dying. She sent out several Scout patrols -- three of which didn't return -- to search for new lifeforms in this scientific endeavour, and to seek out civilizations that might have the terraforming knowledge the Alliance doesn't possess.

To prove that he's not just a worthless male, the Captain has to deliver the [GenesisDevice Genesis Device] to her. There are two possible results:

  * In case she gets the device in time, the Shofixti race can flourish again and Hiruko can grant the aid of the Shoguns -- which means cheaper crew again, and Scout vessels buildable at the Yehat-Pkunk Starbase.
  * In case the Captain can't solve the Shofixti case, the settlement will decline completely and the rest of the Shofixti patrols will be coerced by the Lurg to aid them in the last battle. The Yehat will fall into mourning and even if the Captain succeeded in helping them, the benefits of the Yehat alliance won't be accessible in the end.

*NOTES FOR WRITING*

(1) Shofixti pilots share the beliefs of the Shoguns, and they are the ones who can explain their decisions in detail. For Hiruko it's all just useless male mumbo-jumbo.

(2) Hiruko mentions this. The Captain may correct her that the saviour of the Shofixti race was actually Katana. Hiruko's response to this is effectively _"Well, Tanaka or Katana, it doesn't matter. Males are all the same anyway."_
