  * *Connected races:* [Ariloulaleelay], [Taalo], [Androsynth]
  * *Connected devices:* [StarPortals] to OrzSpace 

== Summary info ==

Associate member of NAFS. Have/has come from *below* to our dimension for some unknown purpose. Orz seem to like it here and want to stay.

After you�ve met and talked with the truespace Androsynth enclave, you will be able to quiz the Orz more on their disappearance. They won�t like this. If you keep pressing them they�ll get angry and become your enemy. You�ll have a decision to make: keep the faith with the Orz at the expense of an Androsynth alliance, or believe the Androsynth (and Arilou) and ditch the Orz.

Orz have been *chasing* Taalo in Orzspace. You get hints about the existence of Taalo from the Orz. I do not think that the Orz have necessarily been doing anything bad to the Taalo. Maybe just having a bit of fun at their expense.

== Detailed info ==

From conversations with Androsynth trapped in *Orzspace*:

 CAPTAIN: We know the Orz. They are those fish-folk in light blue ships that helped us win the war.
 ANDROSYNTH:
 Yes, that's how you see it. 
 They are part of a single entity, they are its fingers sticking out into the reality we used to inhabit. It could well exist there in a less tangible form if it chose to.
 But what we understand of it, that is one of its *time jokes*, masquerading to resemble its environment. What you perceive as Orz in your dimension are made of the atoms and molecules that used to compose the bodies of Androsynth. Reorganized, re-structured... recycled.
 Yet the patterns of our minds and bodies were pulled in and reside here inside the Orz's *mind-skin*. We are like memories. Ghosts... echoes of past.
 CAPTAIN: But that's horrible! Why does it do that?
 ANDROSYNTH:
 We believe it is easier for it to modify existing structures than to construct vessels for interacting with other beings from scratch. 
 As any force in the universe it naturally chooses the easiest path. It is unlikely it even recognizes sentient life as we do due to its different way of understanding and manipulating time and space.
 It *remembers* anything it touches and we are an example of its memories.We sense it sees no wrong in doing what it does and that makes it even more dangerous.
 As for why its projections constantly resemble nautical lifeforms we are not sure of. Perhaps their appearance is a reflection of what Orz looked like in early stages of its evolution.
 Perhaps it is an echo of one of the species it has *assimilated*. From time to time we can hear those other beings, but most of them are too alien for us to even try to understand.
 They are locked in their own sections, trapped like us.
