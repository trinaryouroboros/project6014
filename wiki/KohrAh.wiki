==Historical info==

The Second Doctrinal Conflict of the Ur-Quan was interfered with by the destruction of the Sa-Matra. Both subspecies suffered the loss of the great trophy that would symbolise the supremacy of either philosophy, and with the fall of their leaders they both lost their force of organization. This gave an edge for the [Chmmr] and their allies to cause them great damage and weaken them considerably. The remaining Kzer-Za Lords decided to pull back to directions they came from, and so did the Kohr-Ah. The difference between the two is that part of the Kohr-Ah came back.

==Rath==

Based on the foundations of the Eternal Doctrine, Rath -- a leader considered visionary among his followers -- introduced new tactics: guerrilla war. Instead of fleeing from the enemy, they believe in raising their individual strength by hunting down their _"prey"_, not relying on the security of being in large groups. By gaining strength, they earn their own right to consider their foes _"filth"_, instead of arrogantly taking that granted as birthright of being Ur-Quan.

This caused a schism among the Kohr-Ah, though didn't start an internal conflict, as the followers of Rath still abided to the Eternal Doctrine in their own way. While the majority of their fleet went back into the unknown void, the rest turned backwards and returned to Alliance space as the Kohr-Ah-Rath. Consequentially, the Kohr-Ah-Rath are a constant menace to all races in NAFS space, tying down the [Chmmr] and [Yehat] forces defending their weaker allies -- who still have to be on their toes against the DAX pirates while rebuilding their own civilization.

None of the Kohr-Ah-Rath knows that their secession was caused by the Lurg and serves their interests by weakening both the NAFS and the Kohr-Ah as a whole.

Rath is a Lurg agent. The Lurg invaded his body and is controlling his every move. He must be exposed to convince the Kohr-Ah-Rath to leave our region of space and return to their main fleet.
