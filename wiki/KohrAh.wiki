== Summary info ==

The Kohr-Ah have adopted new tactics: guerrilla war. They are able to wage war from all around the NAFS area, those sneaky bastards. No one knows where their base of operations is.

Are a constant menace to all races in the sector, and a dangerous thing to bump into. [Chmmr] are attempting to remove them. They don't have a large role plot-wise, more of an annoyance in the home quadrant.

 (The only good thing about the Slylandro Probes were their plot with the real Slylandro, and their resources. Perhaps add in some plot that's not completely necessary to go through, but interesting nonetheless. Or have them serve as an antagonist which will swing the player into doing certain things (like fixing the Chmmr after NAFS members pester the player to do so! -- see comment above about the fixing Chmmr bit) == jorisvddonk)

Can they be finally destroyed and how?? Even though some might find it dissatisfying, we don't actually have to "wrap up" the Kohr-Ah, we can just leave them running around guerrilla style. It's really hard to effectively combat a guerrilla war.
