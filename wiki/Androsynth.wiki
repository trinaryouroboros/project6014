== Summary info ==

There are Androsynth in both 1) truespace and 2) Orzspace.

1) The Truespace Androsynth are the �fail-safe or plan B� that Commander Hayes thought the Androsynth would have. They might've been sent to that remote star system well before the IDF incident, maybe already at the clone rebellion on Earth. 

Their small enclave is located in one of three randomly selected systems (Alpha/Delta Apollonius, Beta Messier). The enclave consists of a planetary base, which is guarded by a finite number of Guardian vessels.

The truespace Androsynth were responsible for the disappearance of the second [Shofixti] patrol. They had to blast them out of the skies, otherwise they would've been exposed.

How to find the enclave: The [Melnorme] will tell you of a lone Androsynth vessel stranded in some star system. The Androsynth in the vessel will already try and convince you that the Orz are up to no good. If you don't have an Orz Nemesis ship with you and you sweet-talk to the Androsynth, they will trust you and join your fleet, and tell you the location of their enclave. 

You can only convince the Androsynth enclave that you're not hostile if you still have the stranded Androsynth ship with you, e.g. if you haven�t sold it, or lost it in combat, so there�s proof you haven�t found the enclave by accident and that you have actually helped them. 

The enclave Androsynth are wary and won't trust humans, their old enemies, even though you rescued one of their ships. They know you're in cahoots with the Orz. They don't know the exact details, only know that Orz came to Vulpeculae and their brethren all but disappeared from there. Thus, upon entering the enclave you will be attacked if you have an Orz Nemesis in your fleet.

You can either A) pulverize the Androsynth OR B) tell the [Chmmr] who'll slaveshield the place OR C) stay hush-hush and try some form of co-operation (which will be later possible when you discover the Orzspace Androsynth).

2) Androsynth also reside in Orzspace... sort of. You can encounter Androsynth in Orzspace and at first they appear like a normal hyperspace encounter. Soon it becomes apparent that they're somehow strange . They can be talked to, but nothing more.

Once you have talked to Orzspace Androsynth, you can tell about them to the truespace Androsynth. They wish to know all about it and how you accessed the Orzspace. They will equip you with a modified version of your Temporal Wrapper � the Orzspace escape device � which should work for a vast number of targets, in hope of rescuing their brethren. 

However, as you may have gathered from the ramblings of the Orzspace Androsynth, they cannot be rescued anymore. They are now a part of the Orz. The [Taalo] tell you more about this.

Instead, you can use the Orzspace escape device to free the Taalo from Orzspace - they were never *assimilated* by the Orz. They're just capable of existing in Orzspace due to their different perception and capability of handling time.

The Truespace Androsynth at the Enclave insist that you take one of their vessels with you in the Orzspace. This way they can verify what you are saying about their Orzspace brethren is true. The ship you have to lug around will be the vessel that was stranded and you rescued. He�s your new Fwiffo.

You can put the Orzspace Androsynth out of their misery somehow as an act of mercy. (They specifically ask you to do this, to prevent misconception of the player committing a genocide.) Understandably, the Orz go completely apeshit over that. As a tradeoff, you would gain the gratitude and alliance of the truespace Androsynth.
    
== Detailed info ==

The Androsynth have figured out how to clone themselves. One breakthrough they have made is that they're able to somewhat, VERY slightly alter genes by breaking apart the genes in one cell, and adding genes from another. However, the result of this kind of cloning almost always ends with girls, since their genes are more stable. The Androsynth are searching for their identity as a race.

The Androsynth provide you with the device to escape from OrzSpace. Also, the Taalo will give clues on how to "free" the Orzspace Androsynth from their interdimensional limbo.
