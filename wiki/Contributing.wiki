 * You'll need a google account (either pre-existant or not, either related to a Gmail address or not, it does not matter). Communicate the address for this account to Jaakko or Edmund, they will add you to the list of committers. For the sake of this tutorial, let's assume your account is newbie@star-control.com

 * When you've been added to the project, log in to Google code, go to your Profile (right top of the page), choose Settings, you'll find there a googlecode password (garbled letters and digits). Write it down, it will be useful later on (you'll need it only once, no need to learn it).

 * Download and install TortoiseSVN from there :

 * Choose a place on your hard drive where you would like to keep your local copy of Project6014's code (let's say C:\Mystuff). Open a window in this directory, right-click in a blank spot and choose "SVN Checkout".

 * Then for the URL of the repository use (notice the *s* in https) :

https://code.google.com/p/project6014/source/checkout

 * By default the code will be downloaded to C:\Mystuff\Project6014. Change it if you want and validate.

 * TortoiseSVN will ask you for a login and password. The login is the aforementioned Google account (newbie@star-control.com) and the password is the one you've written down from your Googlecode account.

 * Quick notes about SVN : the two commands you really need to get started (accessible by a right click on your Project6014 directory) are just SVN Update (to fetch the newest revision) and SVN Commit (to send the modifications you've made to everyone else).
A good practice is to ALWAYS update to the latest revision BEFORE committing anything, to avoid conflicts as much as possible.
