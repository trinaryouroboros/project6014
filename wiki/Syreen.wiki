== Summary info ==

Core member of NAFS. They will offer the services of their starbase to you, even when things go sour with the [Chmmr]. Maybe Chmmr will take punitive action. At some point in the game the Syreen officer on the starbase will attempt to seduce you. You will have a choice to make. You are still in relationship with Talana who is back on Vela.

At some point General ZEX's old subordinate DAX (yes, he's alive!) starts attacking Syreen patrols, and later even outposts. DAX is working with the [Lurg] to destabilise the NAFS, and sow discontent. The Syreen notify you about an abnormal number of ships going missing near the former VUX SOI; more than they normally lose to the [KohrAh].

If not checked in time, the DAX/Lurg raids will weaken the Syreen and make their SOI smaller. Eventually this will result in them being unable to participate in the fight against the [Exotics].
