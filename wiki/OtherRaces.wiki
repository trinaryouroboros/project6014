These races won't be featured in the Project 6014 plot:

  * Druuge
  * Ilwrath - dead
  * Mycon - slave-shielded
  * Pkunk - merged into [Yehat]
  * Supox
  * Thraddash - dead
  * Umgah
  * Utwig
  * Ur-Quan - have fled this region
  * Zoq-Fot-Pik

Conversation with other races may allude to them so they still need consistent backstories.  For example, the Umgah have provided ships to the [Slylandro].

It's possible that some of the Allies' ships will be available at starbases.

And all these ships will still be playable in Super Melee.
