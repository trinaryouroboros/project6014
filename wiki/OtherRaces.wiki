These races won't be featured in the Project 6014 plot:

  * Druuge -- Will be left to their own devices. Not included in this mod.
  * Ilwrath -- These guys are dead, dead, dead!!! (Even though there will be some red herrings to hint at their possible presence. At least Commander Hayes suspects Ilwrath activity when an Earthling Cruiser taskforce disappears. Later on it's hinted that the Exotics really destroyed the Cruisers.)
  * Mycon -- Have been slave-shielded by the Chmmr. Will be left to their own devices. Not included in this mod.
  * Pkunk -- Have rejoined the Yehat in Serpentis. You can acquire their Fury vessels but they are not a race you can communicate with and play no real part in this mod.
    * (Ditch the acquiring of Fury vessels, and replace their conversations with something along the lines of "Unfortunately, we're busy integrating our two species fully into our society. Turns out there were a few.. 'differences of opinion'... Come back later for parties and Fury vessels!"? Might totally kill some balance things, though. Perhaps have the player do some generic fetch quest to get Fury vessels, and have the Pkunk explain that "you need some Fury vessels in an epic battle with <insert appearance of alien here>"... -- jorisvddonk)
  * Supox -- Associate member of NAFS. Retired to Beta Librae. Will play no role in this mod. You can still build their Blade vessels though.
  * Thraddash -- There's not one cigar butt left of the Thraddash 'civilization'. What a bummer.
  * Umgah -- Umgah are left to their own devices and will play no part in this mod. (Except that they were the ones that gave the [Slylandro] the modded Marauder ships).
  * Utwig -- Associate member of NAFS. Retired to Gamma Aquarii. The Ultron has told the Utwig to become complete pacifists. Thus they won't partake in NAFS operations and you won't be able to build their overly powerful ships. Will play no role in this mod.
  * Ur-Quan -- Fled this region of space immediately after the Sa-Matra's destruction. Not included in this mod.
  * Zoq-Fot-Pik -- Core member of NAFS, but are too busy rebuilding their homeworld and colonies after the Kohr-Ah devastation that they won't be of any use. In fact they are off the starmap and will play no part in this mod. Their Stinger vessels will be available for construction though.

Conversation with in-game races may allude to these ones so they still need consistent backstories.  For example, the Umgah have provided ships to the Slylandro.

It's possible that some of the Allies' ships will be available at starbases.

And all these ships will still be playable in Super Melee.
