= Introduction =

The Wiki is for general development-related documentation for the game.

This is the Wiki Home.  Ideally, all other Wiki pages should be accessible from here.  Those that aren't can be found via the *[http://code.google.com/p/project6014/w/list list of all Wiki pages]*.

*Spoiler warning!* There is heavy plot discussion in here.
