Ancient tool used by the Precursors, but possibly even older than the Precursors. The Orb is a powerful gravitational manipulation tool, which does weird things to gravity waves on a galaxy-wide scale. 

 (Perhaps it could be used as a way of instant communication across space, and the Exotics actually communicate using these things. The Precursors (relying on slower Hyperwave) stole a few of these devices so that they could communicate with nearly all Precursor vessels using a relay system of Orbs an Hyperwave transmitters. 

 An even slightly more bold idea might be that the Rainbow Worlds all have huge black orbs embedded within them (or act as a cheaper, larger, yet less effective version of the orbs), to provide the Precursors with a galaxy-wide near-instant communication system. Unfortunately, part of this system was still being built (orbs are hard to produce/come by/steal from Exotics?) and thus a few starships of high importancy still contain these devices to act as movable relays. -- jorisvddonk)

Shofixti discover the orb in Lurg space and accidentally set it off. When you show up to investigate, the Lurg attack you as they want the artefact. 

The Exotics were awakened when the orb was activated. The Precursors may have originally stolen the orb from the Exotics, who were about equal in power to the Precursors.

== Additional background ==

 The orb was a very valuable tool for the Precursors and even if they had known it attracts Exotics (they very well might've not known at the time), they would not have wanted to destroy it. This would justify them storing it for a later time. Maybe they wanted to deal with the Exotics first, then go back to using the Orb for whatever it was devised for. Or they didn't know about the Exotics.

 However I don't like the idea of the Orb being usable to e.g. move a planet inside a star system. In SC2, producing huge amounts of light with Sun Device and blowing up stars with a huge bomb sound "doable": that's because there's no precision involved. No need for actually knowing any special skills to use those tools. But I have the feeling that tinkering with the orbit of an entire planet would be a very meticulous procedure. Simply pushing a button on the gravity orb would result in a catastrophe, if not used in exactly in the right spot, at the right time, with the correct amount of gravity etc.

 So I'm for the "Orb not having a discernible function" option. We, the developers, know it's a huge tractor beam or something like that, but the NAFS scientists don't know that, and they don't exactly know how the thing works.
