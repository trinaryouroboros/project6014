# Main Events #

Unaware of the players as the game starts, a series of important events are already in motion. This page describes the overall main background events that are currently in play in Project6014.

A good story would generally have between 3 and 5 main events and each will have heavy ramifications to the player's actions and missions, how races will behave, etc.
Main events can also have a timer associated with them: they will unfold, and unless the player has succeeded with certain missions or choices, they may lead to different status or even game over.
Story writers should therefore think of these aspects when thinking about main events:
**How long has it been going? When did it start?** What caused this event to start?
**What races are involved?** What are the possible outcomes of this event?
**What are the player choices to influence this event?**

The following major events are currently happening in P6014:

## The [Exotics](Exotics.md) are arriving in the Galaxy ##

## The [Chmmr](Chmmr.md) are slowly getting insane and dying ##

More large scale events are needed to improve the story.
