# Sun Device #

  * **Connected races:** [Shofixti](Shofixti.md), [VUX](VUX.md)
  * **Connected Devices:**

The good old Sun Device from UQM. You can donate it to the Shofixti to help make their new homeworld habitable.

Like the Slave shield buster, the [Chmmr](Chmmr.md) have stashed the Sun Device away. There's a similar clue to finding it, but once there, you find only an empty vault: someone has already stolen it!

That someone is the old bastard DAX. Defeat DAX at his starbase and gain the Sun Device.
