## Historical info ##

During the Second Doctrinal Conflict, the Spathi joined the New Alliance of Free Stars as a token of gratitude for the annihilation of Evil Ones on Spathiwa. Their participation in the NAFS didn't last long, as they used their membership to gain safe access to Earth's Slave-Shield, creating their own version with which they sealed themselves away from the rest of the universe.

This is something they couldn't have done before. Of course they never knew that one day someone would just get rid of the Evil Ones for them, that's one thing, but analysing the Slave-Shield technology would have not eluded the attention of the Hierarchy with the supervision of the scary Ilwrath over Earth and Procyon, and the close proximity of their unforgiving Ur-Quan Masters to the Syreens' adopted world Gaia.

As the NAFS emerged victorious and estabilished itself as an official entity, the validity of Spathi membership became a controversial topic among allied races. After all, they ceased contributing as soon as they reached their own goal. Also they didn't make any effort to confirm their intent to stay in the NAFS. To clarify their status, the Chmmr had to make the first move. It was terrifying for the Spathi to see unknown alien ships easily passing through their "impenetrable" planetary shield, though the moment of fear shortly changed into relief when they realized that their visitors came with peaceful intent, even if they were two of their former opponents merged together.

To tell the truth, the Spathi never expected making contact with aliens for a period of indefinitely -- though preferably VERY, VERY, VERY -- long time, and didn't plan to take any part in an inter-species community ever again. The Safe Ones saw that it's safer to keep good relations with people who can just pass their planet's defenses, but they didn't want to lower the Slave-Shield as a requisite for members to keep relations with others open. They refused membership, but they proposed to provide services through the facilities left on the abandoned moon of Spathiwa for the protectorship of the Chmmr.

_Note that only the Chmmr are important to them. If other races want to protect them they're welcome, nevertheless other races couldn't actually harm them under a Slave-Shield._

## Fwiffo ##

When you turn up to Spathiwa's moon to say "hi", the lights are turned off and someone keeps pressing the Captain for a password. You can try out different alternatives, but all of them are wrong - there is no real password. You need to exhaust the password dialogue tree to get a new alternative _"Turn on the lights NOW, maggots!"_ or something like that.

With the lights turning on, things become familiar. The rocky formations in the background and the small structures carved in them, the table in the front are almost identical to the scene we saw years ago. The only significant difference is that instead of the Safe Ones, there's one solitary Spathi at the table playing with oddly shaped ... thingies (that part is not drawn yet). The Spathi recognizes the Captain immediately and reveals his identity to those who didn't guess already: he's **Fwiffo**, our companion we picked up at Pluto.

At some point during the events of The Ur-Quan Masters, Fwiffo eventually became separated from the Captain (1), and having no real alternatives, he begins his journey back home. As he arrived to Spathiwa, he had to realize that he's one of the few unfortunate Spathi locked out on the outside of a barrier surrounding their home. As other like him, he had to search for the -- second -- safest place where a Spathi can be, which turned out to be the underground moonbase with it's infrastructure and life support systems left intact. He settled there, not knowing that years later the Chmmr will come to meet the Safe Ones.

The Chmmr executed their mission as cautiously as they could when they entered Epsilon Gruis. They didn't want to disturb the Spathi unnecessarily, so they planned to survey the whole star system for signs and messages indicating their intentions. What they found is the underground energy readings of the moonbase and it's inhabitants, who didn't have any clue about what the Chmmr wanted to know. As the moonbase Spathi representative conversed with the Chmmr, the Chmmr's ability to pass Slave-Shields came to light, which got the hopes up for everyone on the moon. Since the Chmmr didn't find anything, they headed for Spathiwa -- with the Spathi who pleaded themselves onboard their ships.

Finally Fwiffo and the others stepped on the soil of their homeworld, but Fwiffo himself didn't remain on Spathiwa for long. After the Slave-Shield was erected, all Spathi thought that they actually reached a state of utopian safety. In the beginning at least. A few months later however, many Spathi begun to focus their inherent paranoia on other Spathi, ones who seemed more ... unsafe than other citizens (2). The Safe Ones were aware of this problem, but didn't find any long term solution for it. They were lucky the Chmmr came in the meantime so they could make an agreement, which incorporated the idea of transporting all "unsafe" citizens to operate the facilities on the moonbase. Two birds with one stone. To make things go smoothly and to avoid unrest, these marked citizens were told that they were "chosen" for an "important assignment" as the "most capable candidates", then they were -- figuratively saying -- pushed out through the doorstep.

Fwiffo was one of these Spathi. In fact the Safe Ones had a particular displeasure in seeing the Chmmr bringing him back alive. After all, he's exceptionally unlucky and dangerously fearful, not someone an appropriate safety-loving Spathi citizen would want to keep near. Knowing that Fwiffo has a very skeptical attitude (by Spathi standards), the Safe Ones needed to give him some extra incentive, they themselves "promoted" him to be the chief administrator (or something) on the moonbase.

The incentive both worked and didn't work. Fwiffo knows that his promotion is bogus, still he uses it to distance himself from reality. The Captain is unable to make progress in their conversation unless he confronts Fwiffo with the truth (3). Having a chat with the Spathiwa Defence Force can provide an extra way to do this, but their assistance is not necessary.

**(FAZ) THE FUNROMS**

As Fwiffo reaches to the admission of his exile, he apparently makes his peace with his new situation. After all, it's not really that bad. He's stationed at a high security facility with dozens of planetary defense batteries ensuring his safety and longevity. And if he wants entertainment, there's a few -- five -- [FunROMs](MelnormeFunROMs.md) in his possession Spathi captains traded from the Melnorme (4). This "information" may not seem to be useful at the time, but if the Captain encountered the Faz puzzle already, then he knows about the importance of one particular FunROM, which is actually the basis for the global virtual reality the Faz dwell in.

The Captain may ask Fwiffo to lend him one of his FunROMs, but he only gives one at a time (5). Of course only one is useful in the Faz puzzle, and one of the Captain's tasks is to find out which one is it. To do this he needs to talk with the Faz and make him describe his virtual world. Then he needs to ask Fwiffo to describe his FunROMs and choose the one that's similar to the Faz's description (6)(7).

## Spathiwa Defence Force ##

From the example with the Chmmr, the Safe Ones learned that even a Slave-Shield might be insufficient protection for them. Using a [Slave-Shield Buster](SlaveShieldBuster.md), the Captain can lift the shield from Spathiwa, but that only provokes an encounter with the Spathiwa Defence Force, who are an "elite military outfit" (a.k.a. poor suckers like Fwiffo but a different kind) of a few ... million appointed personnel defending the homeworld. The Captain can either fight an endless battle with them or not, but ultimately he has to leave Spathiwans to their devices. A short time after the Captain left orbit, the planet erects a new shield -- which means of course they got [Slave-Shield Generators](SlaveShieldGenerator.md) (8).

**(XEN-WEYI) THE SLAVE-SHIELD GENERATOR**

In order to save the Shofixti, the Captain has to crack the [Xen-Weyi](XenWeyi.md) shield, but that puts the Xen-Weyi in grave danger. If the Captain wants to end the story with a clear conscience and one less enemy, he has to restore the Xen-Weyi shield. The Spathi are the only ones who have a Slave-Shield device and are willing to give us one ... IF we promise never to harass them again.

If we crack their shield too much, or attack them, or break our promise, they'll turn completely hostile and attack us without negotiation. In these cases we got an immoral ending Spathi-wise, and if we don't have the Slave-Shield Generator already, we lose every chance to save the Xen-Weyi.

**NOTES FOR WRITING**

(1) Because Fwiffo's fate in UQM depends on the Captain's action, we have an opportunity to write a section of Fwiffo's dialogue for clarifications. This section would not affect the rest of the game, it's only purpose is to create an interconnection between P6014's story and the actual decisions of a player who played UQM beforehand. (For example such an element was also used in the beginning of Mass Effect 2 and 3.) As he performs his colored story about how he ended up in the present, the Captain may at some places need to correct him.

(2) The reasons for persecution might be -- by human standards -- amusingly light deviations.

(3) The process is somewhat similar to our first encounter with him in UQM. At that instance, Fwiffo needed to confront his uncertainty and solitude to join the Captain, even though he tried to show himself confident. Again, we need to listen to a long story of his, then give him the final push. This time he won't join us, for he's now at a place of satisfactory safety -- better than with the Captain who's "probably up to something dangerous again".

(4) Might be enriching to mention how Spathi captains gathered biodata only to get some FunROMs for themselves.

(5) The Captain may ask Fwiffo to copy all of the FunROMs to his ship's computer, the answer is a lecture involving "Melnorme Copyright Policies". Fwiffo, being a responsible Spathi, takes copyright very seriously ... and so should you! :D

(6) Fwiffo's descriptions are very enthusiastic, almost like video game advertisings. Even though most of these FunROMs are useless to us, it is certain that all of them are very good games. One useful info Fwiffo remarks is that all of these games become somewhat predictable if one plays for a long time.

(7) Even if the Captain doesn't know the connection between the Faz VR and the right FunROM, he may notice the similarity and a open dialogue option: "Hey, that FunROM sounds kind of familiar". There's a section in Fwiffo's dialogue needed where the Captain can choose the FunROM he'd borrow. To make the choice more abstract and graphical (item icons), Fwiffo may have color coded his FunROMs.

(8) This information can be vaguely expressed by Hayes, the Chmmr, and a bit more specifically by Fwiffo and the Spathiwans. The latter may also refer to the Slave-Shield Buster as an evil/wicked/immoral piece of technology.
