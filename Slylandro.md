## Summary info ##

These guys are the recipient of an Umgah practical joke. The Umgah kindly re-engineered Kohr-ah Marauder vessels to house the gaseous physiology of Slylandro. The Slylandro were delighted in their new capability to explore the cosmos. Unfortunately this makes them prime targets for [Chmmr](Chmmr.md) and other races who destroy Kohr-Ah on sight.

> (Where did they get these Marauders from? Perhaps it would be funny if these Marauders were actually Umgah Drones with fake Marauder shells (camouflage) around them. Disable the ability to communicate (or have some strange transmission with laughter in the background the first time you communicate with them) and it'd be quite funny to get attacked by a Marauder wielding Drone weaponry. :) -- jorisvddonk)

Quite early on in the game, the Chmmr let you in on a piece of distressing news: they have discovered a HUGE fleet of Kohr-Ah marauders approaching NAFS area. The Chmmr send you to evacuate a scientific outpost from the fleet's way OR warn you from not going near whilst they amass a force of Chmmr/Yehat ships to wipe out the fleet.

You can go check out the fleet: upon your encounter with Kohr-ah Marauders you will be delighted to find that you have actually run into Slylandro. You must inform the Chmmr / [Yehat](Yehat.md) about this (maybe bring a Slylandro vessel with you to prove it's true) to prevent a genocide. (The Chmmr won't believe you, but you must instead go talk to the Yehat). If you take too long, the Chmmr/Yehat force slaughters the Slylandro fleet.

The Slylandro will then set a base of operations at some star system, but also send scout vessels around (which you cannot tell from Kohr-Ah vessels before talking to them). They will be a useful source of news, this will make it worthwhile risking running into Kohr-ah vessels.

> (Something tells me these guys will be perfect spies against the Kohr-Ah. -- jorisvddonk)

The Slylandro will find the location of the [MmrnmhrmMotherArk](MmrnmhrmMotherArk.md) in their travels later on in the game and tell it to you.

> (But if they're slaughtered, you won't find the Mother Ark, and won't be able to fix the Chmmr. This might break continuity severely, unless some fallback conversation is built. -- jorisvddonk)
