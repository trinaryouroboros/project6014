You're looking at the readme for 'The Ur-Quan Masters project6014', a
volunteer project that intends to bring a sequel to the classic game
'Star Control II'.

The program code that comprises 'The Ur-Quan Masters project6014' is a
mod of 'The Ur-Quan Masters', which was itself derived from code
written by Toys for Bob, Inc. for the 3DO version of 'Star Control II', with
their permission and encouragement.

If you've got this file from the source tree, you can find everything
you need to get started in INSTALL (INSTALL.mingw for MinGW) and
doc/users/unixinstall.

The home page of the project is located at
http://code.google.com/p/project6014/
You can find links to downloads there.

Have fun!
