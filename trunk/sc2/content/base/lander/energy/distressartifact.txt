     ---- REPORT FROM SURFACE ----

CAPTAIN! WE HAVE DISCOVERED WRECKAGE OF WHAT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN AN ENORMOUS SPACE SHIP.

ONLY PARTIALLY ABOVE GROUND LEVEL, IT IS LODGED FIRMLY IN THE TERRAIN, WHICH INDICATES THE THING HAS BEEN HERE AT LEAST FOR HUNDREDS, MORE PROBABLY FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. IN CONTRAST TO THAT, THE SHIP SEEMS TO BE IN A SURPRISINGLY GOOD CONDITION, APART FROM TWO FIVE-METER WIDE BLACKENED CREVICES ON THE LEFT SIDE OF ITS HULL. SEEING NO OTHER VISIBLE ENTRANCES, WE WILL USE ONE OF THESE HOLES TO ENTER THE SHIP INTERIOR.

...

WE HAVE DISCOVERED A... WORRISOME DETAIL IN THE CARGO HOLD. SPANNING ACROSS THE ENTIRE HOLD LIES IS A GIGANTIC, SPHERICAL BLACK ORB. PERFECTLY SMOOTH AND SHINY ON THE SURFACE, IT DEFINITELY BEARS THE HALLMARKS OF PRECURSOR DESIGN. IT KEEPS CHANGING ITS HUE FROM DEEP BLACK TO A... DARKER SHADE OF BLACK, AND BACK AGAIN. AS IF IT WAS BREATHING.

THE WALLS AND THE FLOOR OF THE CARGO HOLD ARE BADLY MELTED AND BENT.

THIS DAMAGE SEEMS TO HAVE OCCURRED QUITE A BIT MORE RECENTLY THAN THE DEMISE OF THE SHIP ITSELF. FROM THE STATE OF THE SURROUNDINGS WE FIGURE THE SHOFIXTI PATROL MUST HAVE ACCIDENTALLY SET THE THING OFF, AND THAT IT LIES DORMANT NOW.

SINCE WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT CAUSED IT TO BECOME OPERATIONAL (THERE IS NO VISIBLE CONTROL MACHINERY ON THE ORB WHATSOEVER), WE SUGGEST LEAVING IT ALONE FOR THE TIME BEING AND REFRAINING FROM UNNECESSARY SURFACE SCANS, AS THE RADIATION MIGHT DISTURB IT.
