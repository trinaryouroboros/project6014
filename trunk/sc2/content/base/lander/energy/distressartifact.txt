     ---- REPORT FROM SURFACE ----

CAPTAIN! WE HAVE DISCOVERED WRECKAGE OF WHAT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN AN ENORMOUS SPACECRAFT.

ONLY PARTIALLY ABOVE GROUND LEVEL, IT IS LODGED FIRMLY IN THE TERRAIN. THIS INDICATES THE THING HAS BEEN HERE FOR HUNDREDS, MORE PROBABLY FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

IN CONTRAST TO THAT, THE SHIP IS IN A SURPRISINGLY GOOD CONDITION, APART FROM A FOUR-METER WIDE BLACKENED CREVICE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF ITS HULL. SEEING NO OTHER VISIBLE ENTRANCES, WE WILL USE THIS HOLE TO ENTER THE SHIP INTERIOR.

...

WE HAVE DISCOVERED A WORRISOME DETAIL IN THE CARGO HOLD. SPANNING ACROSS THE ENTIRE HOLD LIES IS A GIGANTIC SPHERICAL BLACK ORB. PERFECTLY SMOOTH AND SHINY ON THE SURFACE, IT DEFINITELY BEARS THE HALLMARKS OF PRECURSOR DESIGN. IT KEEPS CHANGING ITS HUE FROM DEEP BLACK TO A... DARKER SHADE OF BLACK. AS IF IT WAS BREATHING.

THE WALLS AND THE FLOOR OF THE CARGO HOLD ARE BADLY MELTED AND BENT.

THIS DAMAGE SEEMS TO HAVE OCCURRED MORE RECENTLY THAN THE DEMISE OF THE SHIP ITSELF. FROM THE SURROUNDINGS WE FIGURE THE SHOFIXTI PATROL MUST HAVE ACCIDENTALLY SET THE THING OFF, AND THAT IT LIES DORMANT NOW.

SINCE WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT CAUSED IT TO BECOME OPERATIONAL, WE SUGGEST LEAVING IT ALONE FOR NOW AND REFRAINING FROM UNNECESSARY SURFACE SCANS, AS THE RADIATION MIGHT DISTURB IT.
