#(HURRY 1)
     ---- REPORT FROM SURFACE ----

SIR, THERE IS SOMETHING STRANGE ON THIS PLANET. 

THE ROCKY TERRAIN IS PATTERNED WITH GEOMETRICAL SHAPES FROM HERE TO ALL THE WAY TO THE HORIZON. THESE SURFACE IMPRINTS RESEMBLE 'CROP CIRCLES' AND LAYOUTS OF GREAT BUILDINGS, YET THIS BARREN PLANET IS DEVOID OF ALL SIGNS OF LIFE.

IT IS AS THOUGH WHOEVER WAS ON THIS PLANET ATTEMPTED TO SWEEP HIS TRACKS CLEAN, BUT DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO FINISH THE JOB... AS IF SOMEONE HAD LEFT IN A GREAT HURRY.

        ---- END OF REPORT ----
