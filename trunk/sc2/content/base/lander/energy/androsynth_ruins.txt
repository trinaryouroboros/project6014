     ---- REPORT FROM SURFACE ----

RESEARCH SCIENTIST LEM REPORTING, SIR. NATURE IS RAPIDLY TAKING OVER THE REMNANTS OF THE ANDROSYNTH CULTURE. MOST OF WHAT USED TO BE ADVANCED CITIES ARE NOW OVERRUN BY FLORA AND LOCAL ANIMALS. 

ALL THE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED SEEMS ALREADY DECAYED BEYOND REPAIR. I DON'T THINK WE WILL FIND MUCH OF USE FROM HERE.

THE RUINS ARE EVERY BIT AS EERIE AS THE STORIES BOYS TOLD US BACK AT THE STARBASE.

IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN... THE FEELING OF ABSENCE IS TANGIBLE, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I HAVE A DEFINITE FEELING THAT SOMEONE IS PRESENT. 

AS IF SOMEONE WAS WATCHING ME.
