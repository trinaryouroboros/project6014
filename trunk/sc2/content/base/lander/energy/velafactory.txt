#(VELAFACTORY 1)
     ---- REPORT FROM SURFACE ----

CAPTAIN, WE HAVE INSPECTED THE PRECURSOR FACTORY AND COLONY SETTLEMENT REMNANTS.

NO LUCK IN THE FACTORY. IF THERE EVER WAS ANYTHING LEFT INTACT AFTER THE UR-QUAN ATTACK, THE ALLIANCE SCIENTISTS HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB SCAVENGING IT AFTER THE WAR.

UPON INSPECTING THE SETTLEMENT THOUGH, WE FOUND SOMETHING OF INTEREST. IT APPEARS TO BE A DRAWING OF AN ORTOG SIGNED BY YOU AT THE TENDER AGE OF SIX. WE THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE IT, CAPTAIN! 

        ---- END OF REPORT ----
