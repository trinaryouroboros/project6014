We are the truespace Androsynth and
we are not programmed yet!
Go visit our cousins in ORZ space
you'll love them for sure!

#(INIT_SPACE_HELLO)	chmmr-000.ogg
So, it got you too.
Comfort yourself with the fact, that
from now on you've got all the time in the world.

#(goodbye_at_hello)
Err... good for you, guys. Until we meet again.

#(AGAIN_HELLO)	chmmr-000.ogg
Again we meet. This does not surprise us.

#(HELLO_GOODBYE)	chmmr-000.ogg
We will. Forever.

#(huh_at_hello)
Huh, got us? What are you talking about?

#(HUH_RESPONSE)	chmmr-000.ogg
I once thought there was no hatred as passionate as ours
towards you - our creators, our subduers. Our slavers.
Ever since our *assimilation* I dreamed of the satisfaction
that one day, perhaps, you too might share our fate.
But now that you're here I am perplexed by my reaction.
I find it a comfort in wretchedness to have companions in woe.

#(angry_at_hello)
Androsynth! I don't know what you're doing here, but you better watch it. We've got some heavy guns pointing at you.

#(interested_at_hello)
So this is where the Androsynth vanished. What happened to you? And what is this place exactly?

#(ANGRY_RESPONSE)	chmmr-000.ogg
Hah hah! You need not fear, old enemy
we couldn't harm you even if we wanted to.
This dimension isn't quite as... physical as the one we used to inhabit.

#(calming_down)
One's got to be careful in strange neighborhood. What is this place anyway?

#(nice_try)
Nice try, bud. Give me one good reason why I wouldn't vaporize you this instant? 

#(WARNING)	chmmr-000.ogg
Since you obviously have not been here for long
you do not know what IT is capable of.
To it, we are little more than
a couple of fingernails or skin hair.
Insignificant enough to stay unnoticed,
yet sensitive enough to convey disturbances.
If you disturb it overtly, you are deemed a disease. What is diseased,
it will heal. It will *dissect* the dysfunction.
You do not want that.
Please, for the sake of what's left of you
don't pursue your aggression further. 

#(will_attack)
Whatever you're babbling of, I know this much: Your ilk can't be trusted. Prepare for battle!

#(not_attack)
That's eerie. We will remain peaceful as long as you will. What IS this place exactly?

#(WILL_COME_TO_YOU)	chmmr-000.ogg
The damage is done. It will come to you.
Real soon.

#(IN_ORZ)	chmmr-000.ogg
A place we should have never found.
Memories of the past are getting scarce to us,
but I'll try to recollect what once was.
After our flight from your oppression and
joining the hierarchy, we invested heavily
in technological research with a single ambition: 
To bring our hated breeders to their knees
to punish the human race.
With our superior intellect, it was a triumph of science!
In just few years of thralldom
nearly all new technology the Ur-Quan adopted came from us.
When we started experimenting on inter-dimensional fatigue
we were at our pinnacle.
We succeeded, opening a portal to another dimension.
We assume similar experiments lead you here.
But, instead of finding something,
something found you.
To be exact, this "dimension" is not where the Orz live.
This dimension IS the Orz.

#(what_about_orz_ships)
But we know the Orz. They are those fish-folk in light blue ships that helped us win the war.

#(RECYCLED)	chmmr-000.ogg
Yes, that's how you see it. 
They are part of a single entity, they are its fingers sticking out
into the reality we used to inhabit.
It could well exist there in a
less tangible form if it chose to.
But what we understand of it, that is one of its *time jokes*,
masquerading to resemble its environment.
An inter-dimensional chameleon dressing into the skin of its prey.
What you perceive as Orz in your dimension
are made of the atoms and molecules that
used to compose the bodies of Androsynth.
Reorganized, re-structured... recycled.
Yet the patterns of our minds and bodies were pulled in
and reside here inside the Orz's *mind-skin*.
We are like memories. Ghosts
echoes of past.

#(thats_horrible)
But that's horrible! Why does it do that?

#(EXISTING_STRUCTURES)	chmmr-000.ogg
We believe it is easier for it to
modify existing structures than to
construct vessels for interacting with other beings from scratch.
As any force in the universe
it naturally chooses the easiest path. 
It is unlikely it even recognizes sentient life as we do
due to its different way of understanding and manipulating time and space.
It *remembers* anything it touches
and we are an example of its memories.
We sense it sees no wrong in doing what it does and
that makes it even more dangerous.
As for why its projections constantly
resemble nautical lifeforms we are not sure of. 
Perhaps their appearance is a reflection of
what Orz looked like in early stages of its evolution.
Perhaps it is an echo of one of the species it has *assimilated*.
From time to time we can hear those beings,
but most of them are too alien for us to even try to understand.
They are locked in their own sections,
trapped like us.

#(not_trapped)
We're not trapped here like you! See, we arrived with this ship through a big blue hole in the space!

#(INDEPENDENT)	chmmr-000.ogg
You are... independent?
That can't be. The only entities not dissolved into Orz we have sensed
are the Taalo.
They can slip through the many *times* of Orz without effort.
But they do not regard us.
Orz will and always has *assimilated* those who cannot
fathom its *times* as Taalo and perhaps Arilou do. 
But still. You don't feel the same
as the other, *assimilated* entities.
You don't *smell* the same.
You feel distinct and remote. How is this possible?

#(kick_ass)
We're kick-ass space gung-hos, not some triangle chested wimps, that's how!

#(rather_not_tell)
I'd rather not tell you. It might hear us, you know.

#(protective_device)
We have a protective device that allows us to travel here.

#(KICKASS_RESPONSE)	chmmr-000.ogg
I see in some ways your species has changed surprisingly little.
Still trying to mask your self-doubt and fears.

#(RATHER_NOT_TELL_RESPONSE)	chmmr-000.ogg
You are wise to be wary
and wiser still if you escape while you can.

#(PROTECTIVE_RESPONSE)	chmmr-000.ogg
If only we had had the foresight to develop such a thing...

#(JOINT_RESPONSE)	chmmr-000.ogg
Whatever the reason you are able to avoid *dissolving* into Orz,
you should be very cautious while in it.
Even if it is now ignoring you, it can
and will catch you if it *smells* you.
It strokes its realm with its fingers.
I believe these fingers will look different from us to your eyes. 
If you notice one, escape it if you value your life as it is! 
If it catches you, you will become like us, and perhaps
the rest of your humankind as well
once it *smells* how you are built, mentally and physically.
I do not know what you hope to find from here
but you really should leave, and fast.

#(i_wish_goodbye)
I wish it hadn't gone like this for you. Goodbye.

#(GIVE_BLAZER)	chmmr-000.ogg
We thank you for your kind words, human.
You cannot rescue us, but we might be able to help you stop the Orz.
ROR-724224 here used to oversee data storage in our homeworld
and is in possession of passwords and codes to access the databases.
Providing you are still able to return and
find your way to a functioning data terminal
on our ravaged homeworld you can use these passwords to access a wealth of information
including the designs of our Blazer starship.
Since your designers modeled us very accurately after your
imperfect, yet functioning physiology
even human pilots should actually be able to operate Blazers after some practice.
There ARE some nasty, lethal and painful booby-traps
in the default ship design specifically
aimed at preventing humans from ever invading a Blazer.
Be sure to remove these from the designs
and everything should be peachy.
