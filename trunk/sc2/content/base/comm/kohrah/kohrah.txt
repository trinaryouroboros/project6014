It is time to cleanse your presence.

With your actions you have
delayed your destiny momentarily.
It does not matter.
Your death is imminent.

#(HELLO_AND_DIE_3)
We are the Ur-Quan Kohr-Ah-Rath.
Our nature, the fulfillment of our fate
requires your destruction.

#(HELLO_AND_DIE_4)
We are the Ur-Quan Kohr-Ah-Rath.
You represent a test to our survival
a challenge to make us stronger.
As nature strengthens life by rooting out the weak
your actions have served the purpose of strengthening us.
As for thousands of years now
our doctrine will prevail.

#(give_up_1)
Anybody home? Your leader is killed, your fleet destroyed. The war is over. You are defeated!

#(NO_GIVE_UP_1)
No, we are not.
You represent a test to our fortitude
a challenge to make us stronger.
It is our nature to conquer that challenge.

#(give_up_2)
Your resistance is pointless! Our alliance is crushing you like insects that you are!

#(NO_GIVE_UP_2)
Yes, it is logical your leaders want you to believe that.
But do you know how swiftly we are building our numbers?
Do you think your allies are fighting as hard as they claim? 
Do you know there is dissension in your ranks?
Not all of those you think of as allies are loyal.

#(give_up_extra_2)
What dissension? Tell us now!

#(NO_GIVE_UP_EXTRA_2)
You already have a doubt in you.
That implies you see the truth in our words.

#(give_up_3)
Your new doctrine sucks. You used to rule the galaxy. Now you can barely stay alive.

#(NO_GIVE_UP_3)
We are growing stronger all the time.
If not today, we will cleanse you ultimately.

#(who_is_rath)
Rath? I thought you guys were plain and simply Kohr-Ah.

#(RATH_IS_GREAT)
Rath is the name we have taken after
a great visionary.
It was Rath, one of us, who showed us our new path
when things were at their bleakest.
When our cowardly cousins, the Kzer-Za, turned their backs and ran
we were in disarray.
We were temporarily unable to resist the attack.
For the first time in thousands of years
we faced a real danger. We could have ended.
If it hadn't been for Rath,
and the new Doctrine she showed us.

#(hmm_new_doctrine)
New doctrine? Do tell us more.

#(THIS_IS_NEW_DOCTRINE) 
Before the destruction of Sa-Matra
we relied too heavily on centralized leadership.
It was our weakness.
We have eradicated that.
Now we keep our forces dispersed, disbanded.
We are everywhere in your midst, yet you cannot find us.
We adapt. We evolve.
As nature strengthens life by rooting out the weak
your actions have served the purpose of strengthening us.
As for thousands of years now,
we will prevail.

#(wheres_talking_pet)
Hey! What happened to the little guy in the corner? Where's your talking pet?

#(TALKING_PET_DEAD)
Your example showed us what an oversight it was
to keep a potential threat in the immediate vicinity.
We learn from our mistakes.
We cleansed the threat. All of them.

#(murderous_bastards)
You murderous bastards! Prepare to be avenged sevenfold!

#(BRING_IT_ON)
It is instrumental for our survival to remove threats.
You will be the next one.

#(we_attack)
You fail to comply even at the brink of destruction. So you die.

#(NO_WE_ATTACK)
No, it will be you.

#(bye)
We offer a chance to leave unscathed. Go now.

#(GOODBYE_AND_DIE)  
We do not need your offers. We just need you to die.

#(DIE_HUMAN)
You die now.
