#(SPACE_HELLO_1a)
Greetings. This is captain 

#(SPACE_HELLO_1b)
 of star cruiser Endeavor.
How can we be of assistance?

#(SPACE_HELLO_1c)
Greetings. This is Captain Decker of star cruiser Endeavor.
How may we assist you?

#(SPACE_HELLO_2)
Welcome home, Captain.
Anything we can assist you with?

#(SPACE_HELLO_3)
Well, look who's back? Good to see you, Captain!


#(ask_news)
Got any hot news from this side of the galaxy?

#(keep_up_goodbye)
Keep up the good work, guys. See you later!

#(short_on_fuel)
You wouldn't happen to have any extra fuel with you? We're running pretty lean.

#(spare_nukes)
Would you have some old nukes to spare?

#(NEWS_1)
Just routine patrol missions.
Keeping an eye out for any Kohr-Ah ships.
I'm afraid, the price of freedom is eternal vigilance.


#(NEWS_2)
I do have something interesting sir.
Last week we lost contact with a cruiser returning
from an escort expedition to Corvi. The last we heard of her
was routine radio traffic near Tauri constellation.
After that, she just vanished. 
HQ is sending a patrol to investigate. It's still enroute.
It could be a malfunction, but I suspect the Kohr-Ah have
changed tactics and mounted a surprise attack.

#(NEWS_3)
The patrol that was sent after the missing cruiser
found no signs of the ship.
I think the Kohr-Ah attacked them, but others disagree.
Usually the Kohr-Ah give us plenty of time
to call for back-up.
They still act like they had
the same power as in the bad old days.
Full frontal attacks, guns blazing. 
I bet they've changed their tactics, maybe
they got a cloaking device.

#(NEWS_4)
Things have quieted down quite a bit.
Lately we've just been sitting idle,
waiting for an assignment to Procyon.

#(NEWS_5)
Not much Captain.
Frankly, I think it's a waste of my skill baby sitting
cargo ships.

#(FUEL_1)
I'm sorry, captain, but the sheer mass of your Explorer ship
makes it pretty pointless to transfer from our limited reserves.

#(FUEL_2)
Your vessel is too large for our fuel to be of any real help.

#(FUEL_3)
Oh, come on! The whole tank of this cruiser
wouldn't move that barge of yours an inch.

#(NUKES_QUESTION)
...Are you serious?

#(serious)
Dead serious.

#(joking)
Just horsing around! Lighten up, buddy!

#(NUKES_SERIOUS)
Lending out nuclear missiles to whoever asked for it?
Quite illogical and against procedure.

#(NUKES_JOKING)
I am not amused Captain. We're still in a state of war.

#(GOODBYE_CAPTAIN_1)
Goodbye. If you see any Kohr-Ah, send them my way.

#(GOODBYE_CAPTAIN_2)
Be careful out there. I know Captains don't often get
the chance to live long enough to prosper.

#(GOODBYE_CAPTAIN_3)
Godspeed on your journey Captain.

#(NEUTRAL_SPACE_HELLO_1)
Friend human. You are hereby cordially invited
to a bloody duel to the death via an impromptu
exchange of nuclear missiles and SDI laser blasts.
...Interested?

#(NEUTRAL_SPACE_HELLO_2)
Greetings, traveler. I present thee two options:
You may cowardly back out of my sight this instant, or
you can be a man and pick a fight with me.
What it'll be?

#(HOSTILE_SPACE_HELLO_1)
Yo, bitch! Wanna fight?

#(HOSTILE_SPACE_HELLO_2)
Yo, yo, yo, wanna exchange a few nukes?

#(yessiree)
Yessiree! Lemme at you!

#(nonono)
No thanks, matey, some other time.

#(MADE_MY_DAY)
Mess with the best, die like the rest.

#(MADE_WOOD)
I know that every captain isn't as great as me.
