Friend human. You are hereby cordially invited
to a bloody duel to the death via an impromptu
exchange of nuclear missiles and SDI laser blasts.
...Interested?

Greetings, traveler. I present thee two options:
You may cowardly back out of my sight this instant, or
you can be a man and pick a fight with me.
What it'll be?

Yo, yo, yo, wanna exchange a few nukes?
