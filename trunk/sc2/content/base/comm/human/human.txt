#(SPACE_HELLO_1)		chmmr-000.ogg
Greetings. This is captain Duncan of SC-37 Vanguard.
How can we be of assistance?

#(SPACE_HELLO_2)		chmmr-000.ogg
Hello, captain. Welcome back to home turf.
Anything we can assist you with?

#(SPACE_HELLO_3)		chmmr-000.ogg
Yes, captain, how can we help you?

#(ask_news)
Got any hot news from this side of the galaxy?

#(keep_up_goodbye)
Keep up the good work, guys. See you later!

#(short_on_fuel)
You wouldn't happen to have any extra fuel with you? We're running pretty lean.

#(spare_nukes)
Would you have some old nukes to spare?

#(NEWS_1)			chmmr-000.ogg
Not much, mainly patrolling the quadrant and escorting trade ships
in case some Kohr-Ah showed up.
Personally, I wish UN allocated more resources for the fleet
The long range of our missiles complements the devastating capabilities of
Avatar ships pretty nicely!

#(NEWS_2)			chmmr-000.ogg
There's some buzz in the air, captain.
Last week we lost contact with a cruiser returning
from an escort expedition to Corvi. The last we heard of her
was routine radio traffic near Tauri constellation.
After that, she just vanished. No distress signal, no nothing.
Maybe it's just a malfunction, but I don't know...
The HQ has sent a patrol to investigate, it's still enroute.

#(NEWS_3)			chmmr-000.ogg
The patrol that was sent after the missing cruiser
found no signs of the ship.
Some say the Kohr-Ah jumped them, but I'm not sure
Usually those black bastards have given us plenty of time to call for back-up.
You see, they still act like they had
the same power as in the bad old days.
If you ask me, I think it was someone else
like someone with a cloaking device.

#(NEWS_4)			chmmr-000.ogg
Things have quieted down quite a bit.
Lately we've just been sitting idle,
waiting for an assignment to Betelgeuse.

#(NEWS_5)			chmmr-000.ogg
Twiddling thumbs, babysitting cargo ships. Not much has happened in the past few days.

#(FUEL_1)			chmmr-000.ogg
I'm sorry, captain, but the sheer volume of your Explorer ship
makes it pretty pointless to transfer from our limited reserves.

#(FUEL_2)			chmmr-000.ogg
Regrettably your vessel is way too big for our fuel to be of any real help.

#(FUEL_3)			chmmr-000.ogg
Oh, come on! The whole tank of this cruiser
wouldn't move that barge of yours an inch.

#(NUKES_QUESTION)		chmmr-000.ogg
...Are you serious?

#(serious)
Dead serious.

#(joking)
Just horsing around! Lighten up, buddy!

#(NUKES_SERIOUS)	chmmr-000.ogg
Hmm... Yeah. Why not?
Why not give you some military-grade nuclear missiles,
face a court martial, get demoted, lose my job,
and die in a gutter somewhere in eastern Kansas!

#(NUKES_JOKING)		chmmr-000.ogg
Hmm. These are no laughing matters. We're still in a state of war, you know.

#(GOODBYE_CAPTAIN_1)
Until next time.

#(GOODBYE_CAPTAIN_2)
You better watch your back, it's still pretty hostile out there.

#(GOODBYE_CAPTAIN_3)
Take care, captain.

#(NEUTRAL_SPACE_HELLO_1)	chmmr-000.ogg
Friend human. You are hereby cordially invited
to a bloody duel to the death via an impromptu
exchange of nuclear missiles and SDI laser blasts.
...Interested?

#(NEUTRAL_SPACE_HELLO_2)	chmmr-000.ogg
Greetings, traveler. I present thee two options:
You may cowardly back out of my sight this instant, or
you can be a man and pick a fight with me.
What it'll be?

#(HOSTILE_SPACE_HELLO_1)	chmmr-000.ogg
Yo, bitch! Wanna fight?

#(HOSTILE_SPACE_HELLO_2)	chmmr-000.ogg
Yo, yo, yo, wanna exchange a few nukes?

#(yessiree)
Yessiree! Lemme at you!

#(nonono)
No thanks, matey, some other time.

#(MADE_MY_DAY)			chmmr-000.ogg
You really made my day, pal!

#(MADE_WOOD)			chmmr-000.ogg
Ah. I guess some captains are made of wood these days.
