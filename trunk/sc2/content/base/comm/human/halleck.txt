#(SPACE_HELLO_1a)
This is captain 

#(SPACE_HELLO_1b)
 of star cruiser Galileo.
Oh. It's you captain. What do you want?

#(SPACE_HELLO_1c)
This is captain Halleck of star cruiser Galileo.
What do ya need?

#(SPACE_HELLO_2)
Hey, captain. You lost or something?
Anything we can assist you with?

#(SPACE_HELLO_3)
Damn it. I'm busy here. What do you want?

#(ask_news)
Got any hot news from this side of the galaxy?

#(keep_up_goodbye)
Keep up the good work, guys. See you later!

#(short_on_fuel)
You wouldn't happen to have any extra fuel with you? We're running pretty lean.

#(spare_nukes)
Would you have some old nukes to spare?

#(NEWS_1)
Not much. Same old crap, different day. Just escort
missions mostly. Boring as hell, until one of those 
damn Kohr-Ah ships show up. Then all hell breaks loose.
I'd rather have boring, I'm not supposed to be here.
But, with Earth being under that damn slave shield for so long,
there's a need for experienced captains, so they
hauled my old butt out of retirement.


#(NEWS_2)
Crap son. Everybody is talking. 
'Bout last week, we lost contact with with a cruiser.
Escort mission to Corvi, I believe. Well, the last we
heard from 'em was routine chit-chat near the Tauri
constellation. After that, nothing. No distress call.
The old girl just disappeared...
I think they got careless and some damn Ur-Quan got 'em
blowed up. HQ is sending somebody over to investigate.


#(NEWS_3)

The patrol that was sent after the missing cruiser
found no signs of the ship.
Some say the Kohr-Ah jumped them, but I'm not sure
Usually those black bastards have given us plenty of time
to call for back-up.
You see, they still act like they had
the same power as in the bad old days.
Full frontal attacks, guns blazing. So full of it.
If you ask me, I think it was someone else
like someone with a cloaking device.

#(NEWS_4)
Things have quieted down quite a bit.
Lately we've just been sitting idle,
waiting for an assignment to Betelgeuse.

#(NEWS_5)
Twiddling thumbs, babysitting cargo ships.
Not much has happened in the past few days.
Of course, that's how I like it. 
With Earth being under that damn slave shield for so long,
they need experienced captains, so they dragged my 
old butt out of retirement. 


#(FUEL_1)
It'll take more fuel from this little old girl to move 
that fat lady you call a ship Captain.

#(FUEL_2)
Figures! Fancy big toy, and you're running out gas?
Your damn toy is too big for our small fuel tanks to 
do much good. 

#(FUEL_3)
Damn it son! The whole tank of this cruiser
wouldn't move that barge of yours an inch.

#(NUKES_QUESTION)
Boy. Are you out of your damn mind?

#(serious)
No, I'm serious.

#(joking)
Just horsing around! Lighten up, old man!

#(NUKES_SERIOUS)
Where they hell are they getting Captains nowadays?!
Some snot-nose kid just out of diapers wants me to 
give out military-grade nuclear missiles, so I can
get a court martial and spend my few remaining years
rotting away in some hell-hole prison?
You're lucky you're not here because I'd kick your ass
just to knock some damn sense into ya.

#(NUKES_JOKING)
Look at me. I'm not one for joking around, son! 
We're still in a state of war!

#(GOODBYE_CAPTAIN_1)
Goodbye Captain. Take care out there.

#(GOODBYE_CAPTAIN_2)
Be careful out there son. I've seen too many good people
die out here. Don't become one of them.

#(GOODBYE_CAPTAIN_3)
Goodbye Captain. God willing, they'll finally let me retire
and the next time we meet we'll be drinking beers 
at my retirement party.

#(NEUTRAL_SPACE_HELLO_1)
I've got the need to kick somebody's ass. 
You Interested boy?

#(NEUTRAL_SPACE_HELLO_2)
Hello Captain. Are you here to see if this old man 
still has it? Because if you are, I'll show you.

#(HOSTILE_SPACE_HELLO_1)
So another hot-shot captain wants a crack
at the old man, huh? See if I'm as good as
they say, huh?

#(HOSTILE_SPACE_HELLO_2)
You want a chance to fight the best, huh?

#(yessiree)
Yessiree! Lemme at you!

#(nonono)
No thanks, matey, some other time.

#(MADE_MY_DAY)
You really made my day, pal!

#(MADE_WOOD)
Come back and see me when you grow
some testicles son.
