#(HELLO_NOW_DOWN_TO_BUSINESS1)
Attention alien vessel, this is Trademaster Greenish of the starship
`Inevitably Successful In All Circumstances'.
We offer trade to enhance your species' way of life
Captain? Is that you?
I must say what a pleasure it is to run into you after all this time.
How are all the Earthlings?

#(hi_doing_great)
We are doing just great! But now I have to sort out some business with a Shofixti gone missing.

#(DOING_GOOD_RESPONSE)
Ah, if it's lost Shofixtis that interest you, I have some very valuable information.
In accordance with our protocols and code of ethics
this information can be given to you in exchange for credits.

#(doing_average)
Just about average. How about yourselves?

#(DOING_AVERAGE_RESPONSE)
Well, with the Ur-Quan and Kohr-Ah removed (mostly) from this region of space
we are doing quite nicely.
Its inhabitants require our goods and services to rebuild their civilisations.

#(not_good)
Could be better to be honest.

#(NOT_GOOD_RESPONSE)
I'm sorry to hear that, Captain.
Perhaps a shiny new bauble will raise your spirits.
I have cunningly acquired two remarkable items
from the Druuge which I am willing to pass on to you
for an astonishly low price.

#(WANT_TO_TRADE)
So, like old times, would you like to resume your trading account?
Of course we still sell fuel and information.

#(how_to_trade)
Sounds good, can you remind me how this works again?

#(TRADING_INFO1)
Certainly captain.

#(MORE_TRADING_INFO)
We are interested in purchasing certain items, specifically
biological data on alien life forms
and the coordinates of certain strange worlds whose radiant energies defy all scanners
producing a rainbow-like image.
In exchange, we have many interesting and valuable commodities, such as
fuel compatible with your starship's HyperDrive thrusters,
technological specifications, allowing you to build new devices for your ship
and many important secrets which may help you in your travels.
To facilitate trade, we translate all your sales into Interstar Credits
with which you may make purchases.
If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.

#(i_remember)
I remember EXACTLY how this works. Let's get down to business.

#(RIGHT_YOU_ARE)
Excellent Captain, of course you do.

#(make_purchases)
I would like to make some purchases.

#(items_to_sell)
I have some items I would like to sell.

#(spank_ass1)
Actually I never really liked the way you made me collect all that bio stuff just so I could save the galaxy. I'm gonna spank yo ass!

#(spank_ass2)
And I think I'm gonna spank yo ass!

#(UNWISE_CAPTAIN)
That would be unwise Captain.  Our vessels are very well equipped to deal with pirates.  
You surprise me with your aggression. I think I will end this communication.

#(only_joke)
Only joke. Let's trade!

#(TRADING_INFO2)
...very well.

#(BATTLE_MELNORME)
You were one of my favourite clients. I'm sure I will find more though.
{battle screen}

#(HELLO_NOW_DOWN_TO_BUSINESS2)	melno001.ogg
As a master trader in the Melnorme merchant fleet, I greet you, Captain.
News of your species and your unusual vessel has travelled quickly.
I need not say how eager we are to trade with you and your kind!
Now, how can I be of service to you?

#(HELLO_NOW_DOWN_TO_BUSINESS3)	melno002.ogg
Hello again, human space captain.
Perhaps during this encounter, we will be able to establish a successful, businesslike relationship.

#(get_on_with_business)
Shall we begin trading now?

#(no_trade_now)
We cannot continue this conversation. Goodbye.

#(OK_NO_TRADE_NOW_BYE)	melno011.ogg
When you wish to trade with us, seek any supergiant star system.
We shall be there.

#(HELLO_AND_DOWN_TO_BUSINESS1)	melno012.ogg
Yes, let us get down to business.

#(HELLO_AND_DOWN_TO_BUSINESS2)	melno013.ogg
How nice to see you again, Captain.

#(HELLO_AND_DOWN_TO_BUSINESS3)	melno014.ogg
I had itchy pods this morning, Captain, and here you are!

#(HELLO_AND_DOWN_TO_BUSINESS4)	melno015.ogg
What a coincidence! I was just talking about you with a Keel-Verezy captain.
They expressed great interest in your explorations and struggles against the Ur-Quan
but, like all Verezy, I'm afraid they were hesitant to introduce themselves for fear of
well, frightening you.
In any event, it is our pleasure to meet you once again.

#(HELLO_AND_DOWN_TO_BUSINESS5)	melno016.ogg
Once again we meet to exchange valuable tangibles.
Isn't this fun?!

#(HELLO_AND_DOWN_TO_BUSINESS6)	melno017.ogg
Your arrival was predicted by our Tzo crystal's vibrations.
We already know why you are here and what you need from us; however
etiquette requires that we act as though we are ignorant of your desires.

#(HELLO_AND_DOWN_TO_BUSINESS7)	melno018.ogg
This very morning, I was just saying to subordinate Ochre
`Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum! I smell the feet of a Hu-Hu-Man!'
We laughed and laughed. What a synchronicity!

#(HELLO_AND_DOWN_TO_BUSINESS8)	melno019.ogg
I must warn you, Captain
this is the time of the month we Melnorme drive exceptionally hard bargains.
Beware!

#(HELLO_AND_DOWN_TO_BUSINESS9)	melno020.ogg
LOOK OUT!
Hoy! What a close call!
Captain, why did you try to run down that Keel-Verezy vessel!?
You almost smashed it into flinders!
What!? You didn't see it? Surely you -- oh
Never mind.

#(HELLO_AND_DOWN_TO_BUSINESS10) melno021.ogg
Welcome back, Captain! You are our favorite customer.

#(whats_my_credit)
What's my Credit balance, if you please?

#(RESCUE_EXPLANATION) melno037.ogg
According to our scanners and other sensitive devices
you are immobile in HyperSpace with no fuel reserves.
This is a serious situation.
Without fuel you shall drift here until your batteries exhaust themselves
then your life-support will fail
and you will expire
unless, of course
a hostile alien vessel finds you here helpless
and annihilates you mercilessly.
This has been known to happen.
However
as a gesture of good will, and in the spirit of friendship, we offer our assistance!
For a nominal fee.

#(RESCUE_AGAIN_1) melno038.ogg
Once more we find ourselves in a position to help you.
How wonderful.

#(RESCUE_AGAIN_2) melno039.ogg
Have you ever considered buying more fuel tanks?
Just a friendly suggestion, Captain.

#(RESCUE_AGAIN_3) melno040.ogg
We have come to help you once more, Captain.

#(RESCUE_AGAIN_4) melno041.ogg
We MUST stop meeting like this, Captain!
Ha, ha, ha!

#(RESCUE_AGAIN_5) melno042.ogg
Out of fuel again, eh, Captain?

#(CHANGED_MIND)	melno043.ogg
Have you changed your mind
and decided to accept our offer of assistance?

#(no_changed_mind)
No thanks, I don't need your help right now.

#(yes_changed_mind)
Perhaps I was hasty in refusing your offer. What was it again?

#(SHOULD_WE_HELP_YOU) melno044.ogg
Would you like us to help you at this time?

#(yes_help)
Yes, I would appreciate your assistance. What is your fee?

#(no_help)
I don't need your help at this time. Maybe later, though.

#(RESCUE_OFFER)	melno045.ogg
You have no Credit balance in our mercantile computer
and our scanners show you that you possess no useful trade goods
but, perhaps we can work out a special deal.
In exchange for our giving you enough fuel to

#(RESCUE_TANKS)	melno046.ogg
fill your tanks, we will take:

#(RESCUE_HOME)	melno047.ogg
get you home, we will take:

#(take_it)
I find I have no choice. I accept your offer... grudgingly.

#(leave_it)
This offer is absurd! I refuse.

#(HAPPY_TO_HAVE_RESCUED) melno048.ogg
The exchange of fuel for equipment is complete.
As always, it is a pleasure doing business with you.
Goodbye, Captain.

#(MAYBE_SEE_YOU_LATER)	melno049.ogg
Well then, we bid you farewell.
We hope to see you again
though with you sitting here, dead in space
vulnerable and alone
we won't hold our breath.

#(GOODBYE_AND_GOODLUCK)	melno050.ogg
Good luck, Captain.

#(GOODBYE_AND_GOODLUCK_AGAIN)	melno051.ogg
Until we meet again, Captain.

#(BUY_OR_SELL)	melno069.ogg
Now, what can we do for you today?

#(goodbye)
Goodbye, Trade Master.

#(why_turned_purple)
Why did your bridge turn purple?

#(TURNED_PURPLE_BECAUSE)	melno070.ogg
That's a good question with a very interesting answer!
The fee for this information is 12,000,000 Credits.

#(NOTHING_TO_SELL)	melno071.ogg
We appreciate your intentions, but you have nothing we wish to buy.

#(WHAT_TO_SELL)	melno072.ogg
What would you like to sell, Captain?

#(OK_DONE_SELLING) melno073.ogg
As you wish.

#(sell_life_data)
I have some data on alien lifeforms.

#(SOLD_LIFE_DATA1)	melno074.ogg
The

#(SOLD_LIFE_DATA2)	melno203.ogg
 units of biological data we downloaded from your ship earn you

#(SOLD_LIFE_DATA3)	melno204.ogg
 Credits.

#(sell_rainbow_locations)
I wish to sell you Rainbow world locations.

#(SOLD_RAINBOW_LOCATIONS1)	melno075.ogg
Your ship's log indicates that you discovered the whereabouts of

#(SOLD_RAINBOW_LOCATIONS2)	melno205.ogg
 of the Rainbow worlds which so fascinate us.
In exchange, we will give you

#(SOLD_RAINBOW_LOCATIONS3)	melno204.ogg
 Credits.

#(sell_precursor_find)
We found a Precursor artifact. Do you want it?

#(SOLD_PRECURSOR_FIND)	melno076.ogg
Always! Absolutely!
In exchange we will give you
N Credits

#(changed_mind_no_sell)
On second thought, I don't think I want to sell anything.

#(done_selling)
I am done selling, for now.

#(NEED_CREDIT)	melno077.ogg
You need Credits to purchase our trade items.
To earn Credits you must sell us the items we desire, which are:

As you know, we carry a large supply of fuel on board which is compatible with your engine system.

we Melnorme have come to learn much about what happens in our galaxy
both now and in the ancient past.
We have also kept records on the diverse alien races in your region of space.
We will share this crucial knowledge with you for a fee of 75 Credits per informative fact.
No refunds.

#(OK_BUY_INFO)	melno088.ogg
How wonderful, Captain!

#(OK_NO_BUY_INFO)	melno089.ogg
What else would you like to buy?

#(OK_DONE_BUYING_INFO)	melno090.ogg
What else would you like to buy?

#(OK_BUY_EVENT_1)
The Alliance high command as well as the Shofixti are in a turmoil
over a patrol of Shofixti scout vessels that were probably destroyed
but managed to transmit a distress call before that.
While the Shofixti are naturally aggrieved over the loss of their friends
the Chmmr have other considerations in mind.
It is most probable that the machinery the distress message was pointing to
is Precursor in origin.
And lately
the Chmmr have devoted a lot of their resources in finding Precursor artifacts.
How we know this all?
Usually it is not in our custom to reveal sources of information
but in this case, it is relevant to the very fact we are selling.
One of our 'agents' was able to intercept the signal while enroute to Archytas near
the Persipina constellation.
We also have news on the other Shofixti patrols.
Whilst we have recently had sightings of the patrol
that was dispatched near the Angstrom system
the one that was tasked with the Messier system is actually missing
and probably destroyed.
Two months ago, the patrol just vanished somewhere near the Messier system
despite our agents' daily checks on them -- they're just gone.
