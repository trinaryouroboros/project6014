#(CHMMR_GREETING_HOME_1)
GREETINGS HUMAN, WELCOME TO PROCYON. OUR FACILITIES ARE AT YOUR DISPOSAL.

#(CHMMR_GREETING2_HOME_2)
GREETINGS HUMAN, WELCOME BACK TO PROCYON. OUR FACILITIES ARE AT YOUR DISPOSAL.
HAVE YOU RECOVERED THE PRECURSOR ARTEFACT?

#(CHMMR_GREETING2_SPACE_1)

#(CHMMR_GREETING2_SPACE_2)

#(CHMMR_GREETING2_SPACE_3)

#(CHMMR_GREETING2_SPACE_4)

WE CHMMR HAVE INHERITED THE NATURAL SUSCEPTIBILITY FOR HYPERWAVE TRANSMISSIONS
FROM OUR CHENJESJU ANCESTORS.



#(yes_but_dont_have)
Yes, I just don't have it on me right now.
    


#(BRING_HERE)
YOU MUST BRING IT HERE. THE CHMMR HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ANALYSE ITS MEANING.

#(not_yet)
Err, not yet actually, where is it again?

#(SEARCH_FOR_IT)
WE HAVE GIVEN YOU THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE ARTEFACT LOCATION.
WE SUGGEST YOU RETURN AND SEARCH THE AREA MORE THOROUGHLY FOR IT.

#(can_we_ask)
Hey, can we ask you some things first?

#(YOU_CAN_ASK)
YOU MAY.

#(better_starship)
This star-ship is lame, can I get a better one?

#(NO_BETTER_STARSHIP)
NO. YOUR SHIP IS AN EXPLORER VESSEL, IDEALLY SUITED TO THE TASK REQUIRED OF IT.

#(where_urquan)
What happened with the Ur-Quan?

#(URQUAN_ARE)
TO OUR BEST KNOWLEDGE THE UR-QUAN KZER-ZA REGROUPED AND LEFT THIS PART OF THE GALAXY
SHORTLY AFTER THE SA-MATRA WAS DESTROYED.
THEY KNEW THEY WERE NO MATCH FOR OUR AVATAR STARSHIPS IN THEIR CURRENT STATE. 
IT MAY BE THAT THEY WILL RETURN WITH RENEWED HOSTILITY.

#(where_kohrah)
Had any luck expelling the Kohr-Ah?

#(KOHRAH_ARE)
THE KOHR-AH STILL POPULATE THIS REGION OF SPACE AND REMAIN A MENACE,
EVEN IF THEY ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO LAY SIEGE TO STAR SYSTEMS LIKE THEY ONCE WERE.
WE WORK WITH THE YEHAT TO DESTROY ROGUE MARAUDER VESSELS.

#(why_kohrah_still_here)
Why do the Kohr-ah still linger?

#(KOHRAH_HERE_BECAUSE)
THE KOHR-AH PRIMAT AND ALMOST ALL OF HER AIDES WERE AMONG THOSE
GUARDING THE SA-MATRA WHEN IT WAS DESTROYED.
THE KOHR-AH ARE NOW WITHOUT LEADERS AND ROAM THE GALAXY AS INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT DIRECTION.
THE UR-QUAN KZER-ZA DID NOT MAKE SUCH A MISTAKE.
WE KNOW THAT THE KOHR-AH WILL REMAIN A THREAT TO SPECIES ACROSS THE GALAXY
SHOULD THEY RE-ORGANISE THEMSELVES.
THIS IS WHY IT IS IMPERATIVE WE DESTROY AS MANY AS POSSIBLY WHILE THEY ARE WEAKENED.
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE REMAINING KOHR-AH STILL TERRORISE
POPULATED PLANETS BEYOND THE ALLIANCE'S REACH.

#(yehat_not_impressed)
The Yehat don't seem too impressed by how you've thrown your weight around in the New Alliance of Free Stars.

#(CHMMR_ARE_AWESOME)
THE CHMMR HAVE INTELLECT AND WISDOM NEVER BEFORE SEEN IN THIS GALAXY.
WE HAVE DRAWN FROM THE BEST QUALITIES OF CHENJESU AND MMRNMHRM.
OUR LEVELS OF TECHNOLOGY ARE ALREADY UNPARALLELED.
OUR PRE-EMINENCE CANNOT BE QUESTIONED. THE PROCESS WAS FLAWLESS AND WE HAVE EMERGED SO.

#(pterodactyls_know_nothing)
Fair enough, what would a flock of super-pterodactyls know anyway! I ask you.

#(SPEAK_TO_YEHAT)
WE WILL SPEAK TO THE YEHAT ABOUT THIS CHANGE OF ATTITUDE.

#(chenjesu_guiding_light)
In the good old days the Chenjesu were first among equals, more a guiding light than leaders as such.

#(CHMMR_PROTECT)
IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS YOU SPEAK OF THE CHENJESU-LED ALLIANCE WAS RESOUNDINGLY DEFEATED BY THE UR-QUAN HIERARCHY.
THE CHMMR WILL TAKE WHATEVER STEPS NECESSARY 
SO THAT A SIMILAR FATE DOES NOT BEFALL THE NEW ALLIANCE OF FREE STARS.
THIS IS OUR PURPOSE. WE WILL SPEAK TO THE YEHAT ABOUT THIS CHANGE OF ATTITUDE.

#(on_our_way)
We'll be on our way now.

#(GOODBYE_HUMAN1)
MAKE HASTE HUMAN. YOU MAY RECREW AND REFUEL AT OUR STARBASE.

#(im_not_comfortable)
I know I don't speak on behalf of Earth on this matter but personally I'm not comfortable with slave shielding other races as the Ur-Quan have done.

#(CHMMR_LECTURE)
EARTHLING, YOU KNOW LITTLE ABOUT WHAT IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT YOUSELF FROM THE TERRORS OF SPACE.
THE MYCON AND VUX WOULD NOT THINK TWICE ABOUT WIPING OUT HUMANITY AND THE OTHER ALLIANCE RACES.
THEIR PAST ACTIONS PROVE THIS. IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE UNDER A SLAVE SHIELD THAT THEY CANNOT HARM YOU.
THE CHMMR DRAW ON THE ACCUMULATED WISDOM OF CHENJESU AND MMRNMHRM.
THERE IS LITTLE REASON FOR YOU TO QUESTION.

#(you_know_best)
Well, you know best!

#(no_race_evil)
No race is purely evil, their actions are a consequence of their environment. Perhaps The Alliance should do more for the VUX and Mycon. Now that the Ur-Quan are defeated they are no longer a threat.

#(CONSEQUENCE)
THERE MUST ALSO BE CONSEQUENCE TO THEIR ACTIONS.
THIS CONVERSATION SERVES NO PURPOSE. YOU DO NOT SPEAK ON BEHALF OF EARTH.

#(FURTHER_QUESTIONS)
DO YOU HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS EARTHLING?

#(no_more_questions)
No, that's all.
