#(gods_work)
I don't need a Cypher, I'm doing God's work.

#(left_at_home)
Dammit, I left it at home!

#(CYPHER_OBSOLETE)
I'm afraid that cypher is obsolete. You clearly have nefarious intent. 
The safest course of action is to eliminate you.

#(GOD_KNOWS)
God would know the cypher, go ask Him or Her.

#(GO_GET_CYPHER)
You had better go back and get it. Return when you have it.

#(turn_lights_on)
Turn the lights on, you snivelling maggots!

#(LIGHTS_NOW_ON)
Ok.

#(be_back_later)
We'll be back to check on you later.

#(telling_off)
Why havent spathi kept to the agreement etc.

#(ANYTHING_ELSE)
Is there anything else you wanted, Captain?

#(BYE)
Bye.
