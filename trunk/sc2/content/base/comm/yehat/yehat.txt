#(YEHAT_GREETING1)
Braaaaarrrrrkkkk! What a delightful surprise
to see our old human captain friend again.
We often think of you and how ye aided the clans
in their revolution to overthrow the Zeep-Reep dynasty.
Stories are told to hatchlings.

#(hail_yehat)
Hail Yehat friends, the pleasure is mutual!

#(what_up)
Hey hey! What up droogs?

#(must_scoot)
Actually, we need to scoot now.

#(WHY_ARE_YOU_HERE1)
Droogs? We know nothing of this. It's been too long.
We thought ye had settled for the quiet life on Vela.

#(WHY_ARE_YOU_HERE2)
It's been too long. We thought ye had settled for the quiet life on Vela.

#(WHY_CHMMR_STARSHIP)
What brings you here in a Chmmr starship?

#(investigating_precursors)
We're investigating a case of missing Shofixti patrol. We thought we'd stop by and say hi.

#(PLEASED_TO_SEE_ALLY)
We're pleased to see our old friend. Missing Shofixti you say.
We have no news on their patrols, but
a Terminator scout group reported something interesting in Gamma Janus
while chasing a lone Kohr-Ah vessel.
Ye might consider checking it out.
Apparently it bore the hall-marks of a Precursor item.
The group was in hot pursuit and had no chance to investigate.

#(reinstate_veepneep)
We've decided that the Veep-Neep were okay after all. We've come to demand you reinstate them as Yehat royalty!

#(BAD_HUMOUR)
If that is earthling humour then I suggest ye kit to yourselves.
The Veep-Neep were a toxic influence on the clan culture of the Yehat.

#(how_are_you)
So how's the New Alliance of Free Stars going for you guys?

#(YEHAT_DOING_GOOD)
The Yehat prosper.
We have expanded our sphere of influence back to where it was
before the great wars.
Since we were battle thralls, we were less scathed by Ur-Quan domination than other races.
While others rebuild their homeworlds,
We've been able to put our energies into helping the Chmmr eliminate
remaining Kohr-Ah Marauders from this region of space.

#(how_are_shofixti)
How are the Shofixti?

#(SHOFIXTI_INFO)
Arrrrrrrk... it saddens me to see them struggle so.
The Shofixti are eking out a meagre existence in the Gorno constellation.
With their old homeworld destroyed they are in a desperate search for more fertile grounds.
Also, the Chmmr won't permit the Alliance to direct too much aid into their struggle
as our resources are needed to eliminate the Kohr-Ah threat.

#(how_are_pkunk)
So what happened to the Pkunk in the end?

#(PKUNK_INFORMATION)
Our Pkunk brethren have integrated back into our society
and have had a profound influence on our outlook on life.
Though I am not sure how they expect to re-integrate biologically
in fact the thought disturbs me somewhat.

#(more_news)
I've been out of the loop. Any more interesting news about the New Alliance of Free Stars?

#(CHMMR_INFO)
Just between ye and me human,
the Chmmr haven't turned out exactly what we thought they'd be.
We expected a supremely benevolent and wise race, much like the Chenjesu.
Well, they are wise, but I'm not sure about benevolent.
They showed little latitude to the Mycon and VUX, not that either race deserved much.
Also I've noticed that they show no mercy to Kohr-Ah.
They take no surrender and just destroy on sight.
Better to be on their side than not to be sure.

#(GOODBYE_EARTHLING)
Goodbye Earthling friend, you are always welcome in Yehat space.
