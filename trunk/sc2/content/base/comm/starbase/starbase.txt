#(explorer_info)
What's your take on this new barge of mine?

#(ABOUT_EXPLORER_SHIP)
Ahh... the Explorer.
The famed joint effort of the new Alliance
in the area of spacecraft engineering.
Although to be fair, the Chmmr easily pitched in most of the tech.
Designed mainly for long-range discovery missions and planetary exploration
the Explorer is a first-response ship, fast, yet versatile.
It is not a mining ship, so you won't have any room for mineral cargo
nor have you any need for that: The Chmmr provide all we need from their
vast pools of mineral wealth. 
In spite of that, you still have room for three planetary landers
and highly sophisticated analysis/containment system exists for taking samples
of biological life. That should provide most useful when dealing with the Melnorme.
Those guys still have a hankering for bio-data from this galactic quadrant
though it makes one wonder
what are they exactly doing with all that data?
But, back to your ship
the fuel tank of 200 standard units should get you pretty far, Captain!
In addition, you can fit up to 6 escort ships into the Explorer's flight hangar.

#(explorer_drawbacks)
So far so good. What about the Explorer's drawbacks?

#(ABOUT_EXPLORER_SHIP_2)
Now, for the bad news.
All that paraphernalia takes a lot of room on your ship, as enormous as it is
so certain equipment just wouldn't fit on board.
For example, there's an absolute minimum of dynamo units.
To cope with the lack of batteries, a couple of low energy ion-bolt guns serve
as your primary weapon.
The guns consume your batteries still pretty rapidly, whilst being on the inaccurate side, so
if I were you, I'd bet my money on the so-called secondary weapon
the confusion blaster.
Based on Melnorme technology, with a few additions of our own
the blaster creates a stasis field around the enemy ship
which will jam its controls momentarily.
The shots also carry some momentum, so they will
knock the target ship around upon impact.
To get the most out of your weapons, use them in tandem
approach your target, disable it with the confuser and let 'em have it!
By then your batteries will be depleted, so... you run like hell.

#(explorer_run)
I have to run from a fight? Give me a break.

#(ABOUT_EXPLORER_SHIP_3)
When you're out there, you call the shots
but as the Explorer was never designed for serious combat,
you're gonna have tough time fighting it out.
We're still light years from Precursor technology, Captain.

#(info_on_races)
I would like some information on other races.

#(INFO_RACES)
Sure thing, Captain. What do you want to know?

#(alliance_races)
An update on our allies would be in order.

#(WHICH_ALLY)
OK. Any particular?

#(chmmr)
The Chmmr.

#(CHMMR_INFO_SB)
The Chmmr have been the de facto leaders of the Alliance
since the end of the war.
They are effective and thorough in their undertakings
sometimes almost overzealously so.
For example, they established the well-instrumented lines of defence
along the borderlines of the Alliance races to protect against the Kohr-Ah
but the Chmmr patrols also make sure no Alliance ship crosses to other
races' territory unless specifically authorized.
You should go to Procyon to ask them more about how the on-going hunt for the remaining Kohr-Ah is going
lately, the Chmmr have been pretty scarce on giving information,
acting almost on a need-to-know basis.

#(shofixti)
The Shofixti.

#(SHOFIXTI_INFO_SB)
The new generation of Shofixti couldn't go on living on this starbase forever, so
they returned quite recently to their home at Gorno constellation.
Since their home planet was obliterated, they eke out on under-developed
colony planets on the neighboring stars. They are persistently trying to
find a new home planet suitable for them. From what I've heard
it is not looking good. 

#(yehat_and_pkunk)
The Yehat and the Pkunk.

#(YEHAT_AND_PKUNK_INFO_SB)
The Yehat really hit it off with their long-lost brethren.
It is written all over their faces: They fit together like Yin and Yang!
Together they've ushered Gamma Serpentis I into a new golden era.
Currently they are trying to help out the Shofixti as much as they can.
However, most of the Yehat forces are instructed by Chmmr to assist in hunting the Kohr-Ah.

#(arilou)
The Arilou.

#(ARILOU_INFO_SB)
As you know, the Arilou vanished again suddenly
as soon as our victory over both the Ur-Quan races was assured.
We haven't seen a trace of them since 2161.

#(syreen)
The Syreen.

#(SYREEN_INFO_SB)
Ha ha, I think your own special Syreen lady is keeping you better informed on
her people's things than me!
Though if you ask me, the Syreen seem to have tamed down a bit
since settling in their new home in Betelgeuse.

#(spathi)
The Spathi.

#(SPATHI_INFO_SB)
The Spathi of Epsilon Gruis keep little contact with the outside world,
and most of them remain under the slave shield. Happily, I guess.
The Chmmr did erect a starbase for them and require the Spathi to do their
share of the Alliance duties. The Spathi are hardly living up to the bargain
they are late again for their monthly dispatch of Nargil yokes.
If you have time, go shake them up a little, will you?

#(zoqfot)
The Zoq-Fot-Pik.

#(ZOQFOT_INFO_SB)
The Zoq-Fot-Pik gave us Frungy.
We gave them vuvuzelas.
That about sums it up.

#(orz)
The Orz.

#(ORZ_INFO_SB)
The Orz... What can you really say about the Orz?
At least they've given artists and sci-fi writers back home a lot to be thankful about.
Our best xeno-linguists have made hardly any progress in deciphering that strange lingo of theirs
after almost a decade of research. And the actions of the Orz
sometimes make as little sense as how they talk.
Now, the fish-folk seem friendly, fun even in a bizarre way, but something about them worries me
and it's not just a gut feeling.
For the last two months
our interstellar telescopes have been picking up very strange readings that emanate from the direction
of the Vulpeculae constellation. The home of the Orz.

#(supox_and_utwig)
The Supox and the Utwig.

#(SUPOX_UTWIG_INFO_SB)
Guess what has been our main export to the Utwig for some years now?
Masks. Masks of "exultant gratification", guises of "gleeful frolic"
face covers of "mirth and merriment" and veils of "unavoidable hangover that still can be overcome in the end".
The Utwig are still in a revelry over your returning the Ultron to them.
We have the best of diplomatic relations.
We did run into a small crisis with the Supox though
when they learned of the existence of vegetarians in our culture.

#(enough_allies)
That is enough about our allies for now.

#(hostile_races)
Tell me what our enemies are conniving!

#(WHICH_ENEMY)
Who do you need information on?

#(urquan)
The Ur-Quan Kzer-Za.

#(UR_QUAN_INFO_SB)
After the initial shock of losing Sa-Matra and facing the
combined attack of the new Alliance, both Ur-Quan races were left
momentarily stupefied. We let them have it with blazing guns.
The Kzer-Za snapped out of it first. Even with their numbers greatly
reduced, they managed to regroup and make a stand, rousing their Kohr-Ah cousins
back to the fight.
The battle was at its most intense. The Ur-Quan could have won the day,
if the Kzer-Za hadn't suddenly turned and hit their afterburners.
They were fleeing with full speed, but we couldn't pursue them
as the Kohr-Ah were fighting us like mad.
We tried to send recon after them when the battle was over, but it was too late.
Until this day, we haven't had any success in finding them.
The Kzer-Za escaped coreward, to the direction from which the Kohr-Ah came
if it's any consolation, at least they cannot find any alien races to subjugate from there.

#(kohrah)
The Ur-Quan Kohr-Ah.

#(KOHR_AH_INFO_SB)
Those guys have the tenacity of cockroaches.
We hammer them with nukes, we incinerate them with lasers,
we scorch 'em, zap'em, blast 'em, smash 'em and they keep coming back!
Since the 'end' of the war they have lodged their fleets in this particular
neighborhood, refusing to give in an inch.
First, they attacked head on just as in the old times, regardless of the enemy force
but recently, they have been resorting more and more to guerrilla tactics,
picking off the easiest targets.
You would think they would run out of ships and manpower pretty quickly with the rate
that the Chmmr and Yehat are grilling them, but on the contrary
it feels like their number has been on the rise lately.
They are our number one enemy now, Captain
and they must have a base of operations somewhere.

#(vux)
The VUX.

#(VUX_INFO_SB)
If one thing hasn't changed in my lifetime, it's the VUX
They still hate the idea of the new Alliance. They still hate humans, they
still despise every other race and they still refuse to give in.
After the war, the VUX refused to join the Alliance or even remain neutral. 
Instead they, literally, stuck to their guns.
So the Alliance forces marched in, and decimated the VUX fleet.
So far it has been the only time that I've heard the Chmmr express any humor
as they presented the VUX leaders that famous option: "Red or blue?"
Ha ha! You know what I'm talking about, Captain
In case you've forgotten, go visit them at Beta Luyten.

#(mycon)
The Mycon.

#(MYCON_INFO_SB)
After much debate, the Mycon were placed under a slave shield in Epsilon Scorpii.
The Chmmr were pretty intent on that. Allowing the Mycon to roam free
would mean a constant danger to whole planets full of life. It would take
just a handful of podships to slip through and plant seeds of destruction
under the surface of an unexpecting planet.
But imprisoning the Mycon poses a new dilemma: They need new planets to reproduce, even if
that means the inevitable destruction of that planet's ecosystem. 
If we keep them under the slave shield indefinitely, we will have doomed them to extinction.

#(androsynth)
The Androsynth.

#(ANDROSYNTH_INFO_SB)
As you know, the Androsynth all but vanished years ago from Eta Vulpeculae
at about the same time as the Orz came into that area. 
Not many a researcher has dared
to venture onto their abandoned home planet after
hearing what happened to your boys down there.
It makes you wonder
we manufactured the Androsynth. We made them into what they were. Intelligent as hell.
Each of them was comparable to a chess grandmaster, always two steps ahead.
How come they didn't have any fail-safe or a back-up plan?

#(ilwrath)
The Ilwrath.

#(ILWRATH_INFO_SB)
Though rumors circulate persistently within the fleet, saying that secret
Ilwrath colonies managed to survive their shootout with the Thraddash,
I would say that's a load of bull.
Research patrols have gone over all the planets in the Tauri
and neighboring areas over and over again, finding not so much as a single mandible.
The Ilwrath are gone for good.

#(thraddash)
The Thraddash.

#(THRADDASH_INFO_SB)
There's not one cigar butt left of the once thriving Thraddash "civilization".
What a bummer.

#(enough_enemies)
That's enough information about our sworn enemies.

#(neutral_races)
What about the unaligned races?

#(WHICH_NEUTRAL)
Which one of them?

#(umgah)
The Umgah.

#(UMGAH_INFO_SB)
Yeah. The jokers. After fighting us viciously in the Ur-Quan ranks,
then hailing you as their great hero, then attacking you with even more vigor after that
they have remained surprisingly loyal
to the 'aggressively neutral' stance they've adopted since.
They won't have much to do with the Alliance, but they don't try
to suck our convoys into their antimatter cones either, so all is well I guess.
Some adventurous souls have opted for surgeries in the hands, or tentacles,
of the Umgah when all else has failed. They can operate like no human doctor
or medbot can, but usually throw in an extra arm or some other useful body part
in the bargain. A small contingent of Umgah emissaries did pay us a visit some
months ago, stating only that 'they have something really fun coming this way
real soon!'

#(melnorme)
The Melnorme.

#(MELNORME_INFO_SB)
The Melnorme traders are always welcome in our neighborhood
not the least because of the enormous help they gave you in your
struggle to free the Alliance worlds. Some say they did it purely
out of self-interest citing the Melnorme trade philosophy
'giving with no fair exchange of goods or services,
is considered vulgar and inappropriate', but I don't care.
They helped us kick some major Ur-Quan butt so they're good guys in my books.
The Melnorme still don't do deals on their home planet like the Druuge traders
even though the Ur-Quan crisis is over.
Instead, they send out trade ships to nexus points around the galaxy.
You can find the nearest Melnorme trade vessel in Alpha Centauri.
They still deal mostly in information, the main item being biological data.
I bet they are still willing to give good credit for the locations of those
perplexing 'rainbow' planets you came across in you journeys. I also heard
the Melnorme are willing to pay top dollar for
'something less tangible'... Dont' ask me.

#(where_melnorme_planet)
Has anyone ever been to the Melnorme home planet?

#(MELNORME_INFO_SB_2)
Not that I know of. It seems none of our allies even knows
where the Melnorme home planet is.

#(druuge)
The Druuge.

#(DRUUGE_INFO_SB)
The Druuge have been booming in business after the fall of the Ur-Quan.
And why not? There's always gullible suckers in the universe
to swindle a couple of starbucks from, right?
The Alliance has made a decision in principle to refrain from
any further commerce with the Druuge
after the incident of the 'Spathi and used Mauler ships for a reasonable price.'

#(slylandro)
The Slylandro.

#(SLYLANDRO_INFO_SB)
Boy I'd like to meet those goofball gas bags, they sound like a fun folk.
But I have my hands tied with running this station and have little chances
of ever getting to do such a trip.
And it's not likely that they would come say 'hi' to me any time soon as
they are confined to their gas giant planet by their unique physiology.
News do tell that they're jittering with excitement over the events of recent.

#(enough_neutral)
Enough on the neutrals, thanks.
#(enough_info_races)
That's enough info for now.

#(ENOUGH_ALLIES_OK)
What other group of aliens are you interested in?
#(ENOUGH_HOSTILES_OK)
What other group of aliens are you interested in?
#(ENOUGH_NEUTRAL_OK)
What other group of aliens are you interested in?
#(ENOUGH_INFO_RACES_OK)
Is there anything else you want to talk about?

#(current_news)
What's the current news?

#(SHOFIXTI_MISSING)
The talk of the town is your mission, Captain.
A group of Shofixti reconnaissance ships has gone missing, leaving no trace
so, we give you the task: To find them.
Why are they so special, one might ask. You know, with the Kohr-Ah on
the loose and the Kzer-Za lurking god knows where, it's hardly
unheard of to lose some ships... We have had our share of cruisers gone missing as well.
What makes this case different is the partial mayday message
the Chmmr were able to record before the transmission died down.
Though garbled, the message was definitely referring to 'machinery', dangerous
and not some small one at that.
We might be talking about something of planetary scale here.
This transmission, supposedly initiated during an orbital scan
was quickly cut short with distress calls... shrieks
The exchanges we've been able to analyze don't make much sense, but for one word
that's repeated several times: Gravity.
I would have brushed that off as random junk as the rest of the recordings, but
a little bit later our cosmologists came forth with abnormal readings
they recorded just at the time of the accident.
They indicate that something resembling strong gravitational lenses
formed all around this quadrant in a matter of seconds
and vanished about as quickly.
Do be careful out there, Captain. This does not sound good to me.

#(lame_map_limit_question)
Why am I confined to this small part of the galaxy? I want to fly wherever I want!

#(LAME_MAP_LIMIT_ANSWER)
You are needed here, Captain.
The Shofixti patrol went missing in this part of the galaxy.
For us, it is an uncharted territory.
They are a long way from home and possibly under dangerous circumstances
what's more, there might be technology from a foreign civilization involved.
You have experience on all of these matters.
Having seen by far the most action of all the pilots we have and
being a natural with first contact situations you have the best chances
of rescuing the Shofixti or at least finding out what happened to them.

#(FIRST_HELLO)
Well, well... look who's coming to town!
Long time, no see. Eh, Captain?




#(BEFORE_WE_GO_ON_1)
 Before we go on, I have something important to tell you.
#(BEFORE_WE_GO_ON_2)
 There is something I think you should know.
#(BEFORE_WE_GO_ON_3)
 By the way, I thought you should know.
#(BEFORE_WE_GO_ON_4)
 Before we proceed, I wanted you to know.
#(BEFORE_WE_GO_ON_5)
 I have some information I think you should hear.
#(BEFORE_WE_GO_ON_6)
 I've been waiting to inform you of a new situation.
#(BEFORE_WE_GO_ON_7)
 I know you're busy, but I've got some news.

#(NORMAL_HELLO_A0)
Welcome back, Captain,
#(NORMAL_HELLO_A1)
.

#(NORMAL_HELLO_B0)
Greetings, Captain.
#(NORMAL_HELLO_B1) 
. I am ready to assist you.

#(NORMAL_HELLO_C0)
It's good to see you again, Captain,
#(NORMAL_HELLO_C1)
.

#(NORMAL_HELLO_D0)
Ah, Captain.
#(NORMAL_HELLO_D1) 
, I'm glad you're back.

#(NORMAL_HELLO_E0)
Hello Captain.

.

#(NORMAL_HELLO_F0)
I am at your disposal, Captain.
#(NORMAL_HELLO_F1)
.

#(NORMAL_HELLO_G0)
Captain
#(NORMAL_HELLO_G1) 
. I'm glad you made it back in one piece.

#(NORMAL_HELLO_H0)
I hope the battle fares well, Captain.
#(NORMAL_HELLO_H1)
.

#(RETURN_HELLO)
Yes, Captain?

#(NORMAL_HELLO_TAIL)
 

#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_A0)
Goodbye, Captain.
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_A1)
.
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_B0)
Bring back lots of minerals, Captain.
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_B1)
.
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_C0)
Return soon, Captain.
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_C1)
.
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_D0)
Farewell Captain.
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_D1)
.
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_E0)
Try to avoid getting gruesomely killed, Captain.
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_E1)
.
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_F0)
We shall await your return, Captain.
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_F1)

#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_G0)
Blow up an Ur-Quan for me, Captain.
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_G1)

#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_H0)
Be careful out there, Captain.
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_H1)
.

#(LIGHT_LOAD_A0)
The more minerals you bring us, Captain
#(LIGHT_LOAD_A1) 
, the faster we'll be able to tackle the Ur-Quan.

#(LIGHT_LOAD_B0)
Light load this time, Captain
#(LIGHT_LOAD_B1)
.

#(LIGHT_LOAD_C0)
Another small load, Captain

#(LIGHT_LOAD_C1)
. Well, I suppose something is better than nothing.

#(LIGHT_LOAD_D0)
I don't mean to criticize, Captain
#(LIGHT_LOAD_D1) 
, but, uh, wouldn't it be more efficient if you could return with larger loads?

#(LIGHT_LOAD_E0)
Pretty small amounts, Captain 
#(LIGHT_LOAD_E1)
.  Bringing those small amounts of minerals is not cost-effective. Try getting larger loads.

#(LIGHT_LOAD_F0)
Not too much today, Captain
#(LIGHT_LOAD_F1) 
. I hope you have better luck next time.

#(LIGHT_LOAD_G0)
Not too much today, Captain
#(LIGHT_LOAD_G1) 
. I hope you have better luck next time.

#(MEDIUM_LOAD_A0)
Not a bad job, Captain
#(MEDIUM_LOAD_A1)
.

#(MEDIUM_LOAD_B0)
Good work, Captain
#(MEDIUM_LOAD_B1)
.

#(MEDIUM_LOAD_C0)
Thanks, Captain
#(MEDIUM_LOAD_C1)
.

#(MEDIUM_LOAD_D0)
Keep it coming, Captain
#(MEDIUM_LOAD_D1)
.

#(MEDIUM_LOAD_E0)
Pretty fair load, Captain
#(MEDIUM_LOAD_E1)
. Can you do better next time?

#(MEDIUM_LOAD_F0)
Don't stop now, Captain
#(MEDIUM_LOAD_F1) 
. We can use every bit you bring us.

#(MEDIUM_LOAD_G0)
A fair haul, Captain
#(MEDIUM_LOAD_G1) 
. Maybe you should consider adding a storage bay so you can gather larger loads.

#(HEAVY_LOAD_A0)
Excellent work, Captain
#(HEAVY_LOAD_A1)
!

#(HEAVY_LOAD_B0)
This will really help, Captain
#(HEAVY_LOAD_B1)
.

#(HEAVY_LOAD_C0)
A fine job, Captain
#(HEAVY_LOAD_C1)
!

#(HEAVY_LOAD_D0)
Wow,
#(HEAVY_LOAD_D1)
, you really hit the mother lode this time!

#(HEAVY_LOAD_E0)
If you can keep this up,
#(HEAVY_LOAD_E1) 
, we'll turn that flagship of yours into a genuine Dreadnought-Killer.

#(HEAVY_LOAD_F0)
Captain
#(HEAVY_LOAD_F1) 
, you are to be commended. Keep up the good work!

#(HEAVY_LOAD_G0)
More fuel for the fire, eh, Captain
#(HEAVY_LOAD_G1) 
?  That last load should keep it blazing!

#(STARBASE_IS_READY_A)
I have good news to report, Captain.
We have successfully integrated the Precursor technology from your ship into our fabricator system
and as you can see, we have already begun minor repairs on 

#(STARBASE_IS_READY_B)
, patching up some of the micro-meteorite holes.
We noticed that your ship does not have an emergency warp escape unit
So our engineers rigged up some for you and each of your escorts.
Now you should be able to escape from a bad situation
with the touch of a button.  But there is a cost, however
The unit gulps up five fuel units each time your Precursor ship uses it.
Also, we now have a limited capacity to make modifications to your ship
to refine starship fuel, to build additional combat ships
and to train new members of your crew for the 

#(STARBASE_IS_READY_C)
 and any ships you acquire for your fleet.
Captain, I know you're eager to get to work, so I'll be brief.
If you have any questions -- how this Starbase works, what resources we need
or just some background information on the galaxy -- don't hesitate to ask.

#(WHAT_KIND_OF_INFO)
Certainly, Captain. What do you need to know?

#(WHICH_FUNCTION)
We can modify your Precursor ship, build additional combat vessels
and supply you with fuel and crew.

#(WHICH_HISTORY)
What aspect of history, Captain?

#(WHICH_MISSION)
Can you be more specific?

#(OK_NO_NEED_INFO)
Fine. Is there anything else you need?

#(ABOUT_FUEL)
This base is designed to service Hierarchy ships.
Fortunately, your flagship uses the same stabilized antimatter technology as Hierarchy vessels
and we'll be able to synthesize what you need.
However, due to the size of your ship, we'll have to produce vast quantities of fuel
which will be a substantial drain on our resources.

#(ABOUT_MODULES)
Our engineers and Precursor specialists agree with the scientists from your world
that your starship was designed to be a `workhorse' vehicle
which can be easily reconfigured for different missions
by adding or swapping self-contained equipment packs which we call `modules'.
The modules we can build right now are:
Thruster units which make your ship move faster
Attitude Jets which allow you to rotate the ship more quickly
Crew Pods which provide life-support facilities for up to 50 additional crew members
Storage Bays which increase your ship's cargo capacity for mineral resources
Fuel Tanks which hold an additional 50 units of fuel
Dynamos which feed energy into your combat energy batteries, improving your weapons' rate of fire.
And last but not least
Ion-Bolt Guns - combat weaponry, the exact function of which depends on its location aboard the ship
when put in the first, or front module slot, it fires a single shot forward
when put in the second slot, it fires two shots spread to the left and right of center
when put in the third slot, it fires two shots directly left and right
and when put in the last or rear slot, it fires a single shot straight backwards.

#(ABOUT_CREW0)
We have almost 2000 highly-motivated, skilled professionals aboard this starbase
and every single one of them wants a berth aboard 
#(ABOUT_CREW1)
. However, each hand we lose to your ship means less manpower here at the starbase
and this is reflected in the Crew RU cost.
As long as you don't lose too many crew members to combat or planet exploration
the RU cost will remain static; but we have only so many warm bodies on this starbase
and if your needs for crew grow beyond a certain point
the cost could increase dramatically.

#(ABOUT_SHIPS)
Our shipyard facilities are sophisticated and fully automated,
permitting a handful of starbase personnel to do the same job
as five-hundred, vac-suited construction workers.
However, the only designs that we had in our computers were incomplete, Hierarchy ship designs.
Things looked grim until one of the officers came forward with an amazing story.
Even though the Ur-Quan destroyed every Earthling Cruiser in the fleet nearly 20 years ago
one of my maintenance engineers was a starship production assistant at the Detroit shipyards.
When Earth was conquered, she was ordered to destroy all ship-construction databases;
but she secretly made copies of the blueprint disks, and then kept them with her ever since.
These disks contain all the data we need to build as many Earthling Cruisers as you want
provided you, Captain, can supply the large amounts of mineral resources required to build those vessels.
In theory, Captain, we could build alien starships here if we had designs for them; however,
it's a well known fact that alien vessels just can't be flown in combat
without native starship captains at the helm.

#(ABOUT_RU)
As you know, Captain, we've committed the entire output of this station
to building your flagship and your battle fleet into the strongest force possible.
However, our resources are very limited, and we feel YOU must decide
how we are to spend our effort and materials.
To aid you in making these decisions, we have implemented a resource allocation scheme.
We provide you with a numerical assessment of the station's resources
and ascribe a cost to each task we can perform and each device we can build.
It's up to you to decide how you are going to `spend' your resource units or `RU' as we call them.
To acquire more RU, you must bring resources back to the starbase.
These resources can be either in the form of mineral ores gathered from planet surfaces
or already-refined metals and other valuable materials from the wreckage of enemy starships.

#(ABOUT_MINERALS)
The most straightforward way you can accumulate Resource Units
is to bring mineral ores back to this starbase.
There are probably enough resources in just the nearby dozen stars
to build your ship into a powerful battleship, or
to create a strong task force of combat vessels.
I would also recommend that you build several additional Storage Bays.
When gathering minerals, focus on `cleaning-out' one star system at a time.
This way, you minimize the cost of travel through HyperSpace.

#(ABOUT_LIFE)
While I respect your search for abstract knowledge
frankly, Captain, in our present circumstances I see little use for such data here.
Perhaps you can make use of biological information elsewhere.

#(OK_ENOUGH_STARBASE)
What else can I tell you?

#(OK_ENOUGH_MISSION)
What else can I tell you?

#(GET_MINERALS)
If you have the patience, I would recommend you spend several months
or even a year gathering mineral resources.
You can find such minerals on almost any planet surface,
but the quality and density will vary depending on the type of planet you're on.
Base metals are probably the most common materials you'll find, but they aren't particularly valuable.
You can find rarer precious and radioactive elements on metal-rich worlds such as Mercury.
An old miner once told me that you could tell the relative quality of a planet's minerals
based on the planet's color as seen from space.
To remember the color sequence from good to bad
The miner had a mnemonic which went something like
`Very Young Orangutans Could Grow Bananas, Perhaps Rather Well'.
It is also the case that mineral yields will be better at hotter stars.
Temperature is related to the size and color of a star
Red stars are the coolest, then orange, yellow, green, blue
And the hottest stars are white.

#(ABOUT_ALIENS)
That all depends on whom you meet, doesn't it, Captain?
Well, in all seriousness, if you encounter the Ilwrath, VUX, Androsynth, or other Hierarchy battle thralls
I wouldn't hold out much hope for a peaceful encounter.
So if you feel you have the advantage, attack!
The resources you will scavenge from the enemies' wreckage are well worth the effort.
If you can find Alliance races who are in a position to help us
then you MUST convince them to join with us!
Their assistance may be crucial to our success.

#(MUST_DEFEAT)
Captain, I wish I had an easy answer, but I don't.
The only way I can see of liberating Earth, as well as the Alliance allies
is to destroy the Ur-Quan and their armada of battle thralls entirely.

#(DEFEAT_LIKE_SO)
To defeat our enemies, we will need awesome strength, both in your flagship and the fleet
as well as the assistance of powerful new allies.
Though combat will be unavoidable, and sometimes necessary to achieve our goals
I am certain your wits will be at least as important as your weapons.
You will need to explore this region of space, gathering resources and information wherever you go.

#(FIND_URQUAN)
I don't know, Captain,
but I suspect their battle thralls know more than we do;
so I suggest you try to gather information from them, perhaps by force.

#(FIGHT_URQUAN)
At first, your ship will be far too vulnerable to permit frontal assaults on the Ur-Quan.
Even when your ship is at full power, we are faced with the reality
that the Hierarchy has THOUSANDS of ships
You cannot win the fight alone, Captain. You need allies.
Also, towards the end of the War, when the Hierarchy broke through the coreward front,
we heard rumors that the Ur-Quan had unleashed some kind of super-weapon
which was unstoppable by normal means.
You need to find out if that rumor was true, Captain
because if the Ur-Quan do have such a weapon, we'll have to find some way to stop it
or all our efforts are for naught.

#(ALLY_LIKE_SO)
If you encounter an unknown alien race, proceed carefully and diplomatically --
-- we need all the friends we can get, and we certainly can't afford any more enemies. 
Remember, Captain, with your Precursor starship, you hold awesome power
but there will be situations when dealing with an alien race
where a `carrot' will serve better than a `stick'.
But first you must determine what `carrot' the alien wants.

#(STRONG_LIKE_SO)
You need to accumulate enough resources so that we can build up your flagship
and assemble a strong fleet. I'd also recommend
that you acquire blueprints for other, more powerful ships than our trusty Cruiser.
I suspect that aliens will not give you such `prints unless you form an alliance with them.

#(OK_ENOUGH_DEFEAT)
What else can we discuss?

#(WHICH_ALIEN)
Which group of aliens?

#(WHICH_WAR)
What about the War?

#(WHICH_ANCIENT)
We have some data on this subject.  What do you want to know about?

#(OK_ENOUGH_HISTORY)
Sure. Anything else?

#(WHICH_ALLIANCE)
Okay, which race?

#(WHICH_HIERARCHY)
Which species?

#(ABOUT_OTHER)
None that we had made formal contact with.
The Chenjesu implied that they had met 2 other starfaring species
one near the Giclas constellation, and the other directly coreward from Procyon.
The Ariloulaleelay once mentioned having `some fun' with an alien race in Draconis
but like so much else with the Arilou, they never revealed the whole story.
I am sure there are hundreds more alien races in our galaxy,
but beyond what I've told you, your guess is as good as mine.

#(OK_ENOUGH_ALIENS)
Would you like information on any other aspect of history?

#(ABOUT_SHOFIXTI)
The Shofixti are a race of intelligent marsupials who had been `civilized' for only a few decades when the War began.
They were discovered in the Delta Gorno star system by the Yehat
who adopted and then `uplifted' the Shofixti, giving them advanced technology and cultural definition.
Shofixti are noble and fearless Warriors, Captain. In addition, their incredible fecundity and rapid maturation rate
kept Alliance ranks solid even at the worst part of the War.
You know, I once flew as a observer aboard one of their ships
on routine patrol, we never saw the enemy
but I could never stop thinking about the `Glory Device' it had strapped to the bottom of its hull.

#(ABOUT_YEHAT)
The Yehat are a race of ancient warrior clans that have been traveling the stars for many centuries.
The clans are highly competitive and sometimes even wage war on each other;
but the clans are all loyal to the Queen and her royal family, known as the Veep-Zeeps.
The Veep-Zeeps have been in power for over 2,000 years, and it is said that during their rule
the Yehat never lost a battle.

#(ABOUT_ARILOU)
I'd like to think I'm not a bigoted person, Captain, especially when it comes to allies
but there is just something about those Arilou that gives me the creeps.
One thing I'll say for them, though
they possess some technique for moving REALLY fast through HyperSpace.
They never let us know what it was, but it sure beats the pants off our fastest ships.

#(ABOUT_CHENJESU)
The Chenjesu were leaders of the Alliance, even though they refused to accept formally the title.
I don't know if their silicon-based biology is just plain superior to our old carbon models
or if their fantastic intellects were the product of an ancient, peaceful culture.
Whatever the reason, I'd rather be taking orders from a Chenjesu than any other lifeform, absolutely.
One of the more amazing things about them was that they never used HyperWave communicators.
They could send messages naturally
And their natural HyperWave receptors were much more sensitive than even our best units.

#(ABOUT_MMRNMHRM)
We didn't really get much of a chance to learn about those mechanical beings,
but I'll tell you what I know.
They are the product of a distant, unknown culture
who sent a giant Factory-Ark into our region of space many centuries ago.
The Mother-Ark (that's what the Earth press called it) churned out millions of robots and finally broke down.
I don't know why the Mmrnmhrm didn't repair the Mother-Ark, maybe they can't.
My personal guess as to why they were sent here is that they're on the leading edge of a colonization project
and once the Mmrnmhrm have tamed enough new worlds, the genuine colonists -- whoever they are
will arrive and claim their due.

#(ABOUT_SYREEN)
Most raw recruits saw the Syreen as nothing more than warm, breathing pin-ups.
Warm they are, and yes, they do breathe most magnificently
but Captain, they are far more than simple joy units.
Their history shows that the Syreen established and maintained a peaceful culture
from their Bronze Age through their discovery of starflight.
Before their planet was destroyed in a horrible cataclysm, their world was an Eden.

#(OK_ENOUGH_ALLIANCE)
What other group of aliens are you interested in?

#(ABOUT_URQUAN)
Our enemy is cunning, relentless and possesses technology superior to all but, perhaps
that found aboard your starship.
The Ur-Quan are born, live and die for one purpose only:
the subjugation of all other intelligent life in the galaxy.
Why? I don't know.
They'd probably have an easier time just destroying intelligence
but they are very careful not to use more force than is necessary to achieve their victim's submission.
I'd sure like to know what made those wormy bastards as twisted as they are
and I'd like to know why they keep on the move, never stopping longer than it takes
to enslave whomever they find.

#(ABOUT_MYCON)
The Mycons are hard to get a handle on.
In fact, I'm not sure any human has ever had a real conversation with a Mycon.
What we know of them we have learned from their corpses, which, I may add
have a nasty habit of coming back to life when thawed out from a decompression quick-freeze.
Mycon ships seem to expend a significant amount of energy on life support.
This is probably because the Mycon only thrive in temperatures close to the melting point of lead.
As far as we know, the Mycon are the only race to actively seek out the Ur-Quan
in order to become combat slaves.

#(ABOUT_SPATHI)
Imagine facing a cowardly, mobile clam armed with a howitzer
and you've got good idea of what it's like dealing with a Spathi.
Although they tend to avoid battles as much as their masters will allow
Once in battle, a Spathi Eluder is one tough cookie.
I once heard a rumor, though I don't like to believe in it myself,
that a rogue band of courageous Spathi broke away from the main starfleet,
painted their ships black with bright red stripes
and formed the `Black Spathi Squadron', dedicated to performing brave and hostile deeds.
Like I said, I'd have to see it to believe it.

#(ABOUT_UMGAH)
It's unfortunate that the Umgah fell to the Ur-Quan so early in the War
because I suspect we would have gotten along well with those big blob creatures;
at the very least it would have been entertaining.
We know them a bit better than most races, because they were eager to talk with our ships
before, after, and during battle.
The Arilou intimated that they had a relationship with the Umgah before the Ur-Quan arrived
but I don't know any details.

#(ABOUT_ANDROSYNTH)
When I was flying combat missions along the Coreward Front
there was nothing we feared more than the Androsynth Hit-And-Run Squadron.
Their Blazer ships were more than a match for our Cruisers
so we stayed clear of Eta Vulpeculae, their home star.
In addition, I think each of us aboard the ship knew deep down in our hearts
that the Androsynth had a damn good reason for hating us.
Our grandparents had kept them as slaves for nearly 50 years.

#(ABOUT_VUX)
The starship Far Voyager, under the command of Captain Jeffry L. Rand, encountered the VUX near Beta Mira.
Although the details are hazy, it is generally accepted that Rand offended the VUX starship Commander
with an inadvertent insult.

#(ABOUT_ILWRATH)
I still have nightmares about those spiders
taking me prisoner -- using me as one of their sick sacrifices to Dogar and Kazon
their twin gods of destruction and torment.
Those guys were almost as scary as the Androsynth to those of us in deep-space patrol.
Their Avenger ships could appear out of nowhere and melt a Cruiser down to slag in seconds.
Luckily for us, the bulk of the Ilwrath fleet was thrown against the Chenjesu and the Mmrnmhrm.

#(OK_ENOUGH_HIERARCHY)
What other group of aliens are you interested in?

#(ABOUT_PRECURSORS)
Hell, you probably know more about them than I do, but here goes... about 200,000 years ago
when our great-to-the-nth-grandparents were just starting to play with stone knives and bearskins
a starfaring species suddenly appeared on the galactic scene and spread like wildfire.
We've found evidence of their presence just about everywhere
from an orbital platform in Alpha Centauri, to a stack of DataPlates in a cave on Pluto
to some nameless widget found in a voodoo shop in New Orleans.
Though we've never found a Precursor body, or even a picture of one
we can conjecture what they looked like by examining the scale and layout of their equipment.
Such an analysis indicates they were giants, say 5 to 8 meters tall, and twice as wide.
I don't know if they looked more like a brontosaur or an elephant.
Anyway, about three thousand years after the Precursors made their dramatic appearance
they vanished, poof! As far as we can tell, it took less than a decade to happen.

#(ABOUT_OLD_RACES)
You mean besides the Precursors? Well, the only information we have is second-hand
based on some research by a Chenjesu historian that I read at the Academy.
Tzzz-Tzer-Tzak, the historian, found some evidence that there was a group of alien races
who formed an interstellar empire not too far from here about 22,000 years ago.
The only species in this empire actually lived in our region of space
was a race of rocklike creatures who lived in the Vulpeculae constellation.
The presence of the hostile Androsynth in that part of space
severely limited Tzzz-Tzer-Tzak's research.
He never even found out the race's name.

#(ABOUT_ALIENS_ON_EARTH)
Yes, there is.
Aside from the Precursor relics we have found on Earth --
-- often in museums, mislabeled as `modern art' --
-- we have discovered disturbing evidence of much more recent visitations.
Perhaps you are already aware that during the mid-to-late 20th century
there were uncountable UFO sightings, as well as dozens of reported `encounters' with alien life forms.
Although we can discount many of the reports as wishful fabrication or traumatic-translation
the military authorities of that time kept a secret record of the `incidents' which were legitimate.
In each such case, the aliens are almost identical in appearance.
They have white skin and minimal facial features, except for huge, almond-shaped eyes
which are often described as `glowing' or `luminescent'.
This description fits, almost perfectly, the Ariloulaleelay.
In most of the legitimate encounters
the people involved described being physically examined or modified by the aliens.
In some cases, unusual pregnancies occurred, and in almost every instance, there were repeat visitations
as though the Ariloulaleelay were doing `check-ups' on their subjects.
We never got the chance to confront the Ariloulaleelay about what they did to us and why.
I wonder if we ever will?

#(OK_ENOUGH_ANCIENT)
Would you like information on any other aspect of history?

#(URQUAN_STARTED_WAR)
Earth got involved late in the game, in 2112, when the Chenjesu arrived in our solar system for the first time
so let's back up a few years to 2098
when the Chenjesu's super-sensitive receivers detected a strange signal from the Ophiuchi constellation.
Though even the Chenjesu didn't know it, it was the first sign of the Ur-Quan's arrival.
The Ur-Quan, having detected the presence of many sentient species, were beaming out an exulting hunting cry.
The first direct evidence of the Ur-Quan's intent
was the sudden conquest of the Umgah, a solitary, though not unfriendly, species in the Orionis constellation.
The Chenjesu, distraught by the invasion, were further angered when the Ur-Quan
turned their fleets on the hostile but weak Ilwrath race.
A hastily assembled defense force of Mmrnmhrm and Chenjesu vessels turned the Ur-Quan fleet aside
but the invader moved into Spathi space, rapidly subjugating that race.
With each new conquest, the Ur-Quan fleet grew larger as it added slave vessels to its ranks.
Earth joined the Chenjesu to form the Alliance of Free Stars at about the same time as
the Androsynth stars fell to the Ur-Quan armada.
Before the ink was dry on our agreement with the Chenjesu in 2116
a new race appeared in orbit around the moon and asked for admittance to the Alliance
it was the Ariloulaleelay.
The timing seemed unusual and the Arilou were definitely weird, looking like Saucer Men from Mars
but we were too busy cranking up our moth-balled heavy industry
that we didn't really pay it much attention at the time.

#(WAR_WAS_LIKE_SO)
At the start of the war, here on Earth we were working like crazy
churning out hundreds of heavy Cruisers and smaller support vehicles.
The Ur-Quan were busy too.  Unbeknownst to us, they had moved down toward the Luyten star group
and were attacking the VUX, who only the Yehat knew existed.
Our botched first contact with the VUX took place in 2119, and it was the biggest single mistake we made during the War.
After defeating the VUX, the Ur-Quan fleets ran smack into the combined might of the Yehat and Shofixti
supported by the first wave of our cruisers.
Again the Ur-Quan turned away from the hard spot to attack the weak, though we just thought they were running away.
In fact, the Ur-Quan had found another independent alien race, the Mycon, in the Brahe constellation.
The Mycon's voluntary submission to the Ur-Quan
brought the return of the Ur-Quan fleets, now swollen with a hundred devastating Mycon Podships.
The last entrants to the conflict were the Syreen, a race of space gypsies
who had escaped the Hierarchy by moving their vast fleet of slow-moving habitats into human space.
With the sides set, the last Ur-Quan offensive began.

#(LOST_WAR_BECAUSE)
The Ur-Quan came roaring through VUX space, and tried to push past the Indi and Mira star systems.
Their onslaught was barely repulsed and our counter-attack made hardly a dent in the Hierarchy forces
but we held the line -- The Coreward front remained intact.
Over the following ten years, there were many great battles between the combined Alliance starfleet
and the Ur-Quan and their Hierarchy of Battle Thralls.
Then, in 2134, a dramatic shift in the balance of power took place --
-- this must have been about the time the science research mission was sent to the planet at Vela --
-- our fleets were pushed back from the Indi-Mira line to beyond Raynet.
Holding Rigel cost grievously in Chenjesu forces and the Ur-Quan, recognizing this weakness
shifted to focus the brunt of their forces on Procyon.
That was the last we heard from the Chenjesu and the Mmrnmhrm.
A few weeks later, waves of ships hit us from all directions.
When Ceres Station, our outpost in the Asteroid belt, fell to the Hierarchy, we knew we were beaten
but we fought on anyway.
Three days later the Ur-Quan vaporized our last remaining laser-forts on the moon
and the Dreadnoughts took up geo-synchronous position above Rome
Moscow, Beijing, Tokyo, London, Buenos Aires, and Washington.
We'd lost the War and we knew it, but the Ur-Quan decided to make it real clear --
-- and that's why if you check any of our most recent maps, you won't find Buenos Aires.

#(AFTER_WAR)
After the UN submitted their formal surrender
we were given a week to decide the nature of our servitude.
The Ur-Quan demanded that the decision be made through popular vote.
When all the votes were tallied, Earth had chosen not to fight for the Ur-Quan
we had become a fallow slave world.
We were given a month to withdraw all of our people and equipment to Earth.
Anyone or anything we left off-planet would be destroyed after the shield went up.
Then the Ur-Quan broadcast an odd message
all objects of human construction more than 500 years old were `to be abandoned'.
We didn't know what the Ur-Quan meant until they moved their Dreadnoughts to new orbital positions
and opened fire on the surface with their fusion weapons.
In seconds, large sections of London, Paris, and other European cities were incinerated.
At first we thought they were going to annihilate us after all
and we noticed that they were also striking such targets as the Giza Pyramids
the Parthenon in Athens, and Stonehenge. Curiously, The United States was almost untouched.
The flaming rain lasted 40 hellish hours.
It took days after we crawled from our smoldering shelters to realize what the Ur-Quan had done.
Our new masters had targeted every building, monument or other manmade construction older than 500 years
and destroyed it.
In those two days, we lost most of the history of Mankind.
In some cases, the Ur-Quan destroyed places
we did not even suspect were significant.
From their positions in orbit, the Dreadnoughts blew away a kilometer of land in central Iraq
vaporized several targets in the Amazon rain forest
punched a big hole through the Antarctic icecap to destroy something deep under the surface
and melted a broad swath of the ocean floor in the south-eastern Atlantic.
Then, just a couple of days later, the shield went up
and our contact with the outside world stopped.
The next time I saw the stars was 8 years ago,
when I was transferred up here to be the new commander of this starbase.

#(OK_ENOUGH_WAR)
Would you like any information on any other aspect of history?

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_TAIL)
That's all for now, Captain.

#(BETWEEN_BULLETINS)
also

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_1)
Captain, a delegation of Spathi has just arrived here under orders from their High Council
to form an alliance and assist you against the Hierarchy!
They have provided fabricator blueprint data for their `Eluder' spacecraft
and promise a steady supply of captains for as many ships as we build.
Excellent work, Captain!

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_2)
It would appear that your diplomatic efforts have struck gold, Captain.
We have been contacted by a race called the Zoq-Fot-Pik,
who wish to fulfill their part of `the Unification' --
-- something you have arranged with them, I gather.
They have sent us specifications for their Stinger-class attack vessels
as well as a large number of Zoq-Fot-Pik commanding officers.
You're doing a fine job, Captain.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_3)
A race of plant creatures called the Supox have arrived in your absence, Captain.
They offered use of their ship designs and will supply you as many starship captains as we require.
I, of course, accepted their offer immediately.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_4)
A small contingent of Utwig has visited.
After spending a few days setting up our fabricators to build their Jugger starships
and providing us with a few capable commanders, they departed.
Captain, if you continue to build such strong alliances
we will surely win our battle against the Ur-Quan!

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_5)
We have been invaded by an alien race calling themselves the `Orz', though so far the invasion is a friendly one.
The fishlike creatures have been stomping around the base in their robotic walking exoskeletons
which look like combat vac-suits, if you ask me.
Based on the summary reports I've seen on their `Nemesis' ship design, I have but a single comment:
I like it!
I'd say we have quite a nasty little surprise in store for the Ur-Quan the next time you tangle with them.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_6)
Good news, Captain!
With no announcement, a small fleet of Ariloulaleelay popped into space adjacent to our starbase
scaring the hell out of the Deep-Radar operator
but right now I could kiss every one of those pale little weirdoes
because they gave us three Skiff vessels!

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_7)
We are receiving a priority distress call from the Zoq-Fot Homeworld at Alpha Tucanae.
The signal was urgent but extremely weak. The only portions of the transmission that we can be sure of are:
`HELP!'
`BLACK DESTROYER!'
`PLANET UNDER ATTACK!'
`HELP!'
`WORSE THAN ZEBRANKY!' (whatever that means)
and finally
`HELP!'

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_8)
A previously unknown alien race has recently made contact with our base.
They call themselves the Melnorme, and they are anxious to initiate trading relations with us.
If we are interested, they suggest making a rendezvous at Alpha Centauri.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_9)
The Melnorme have returned, wondering when you want to meet them.
They seemed friendly but are unwilling to deal with us,
claiming that we have no data they consider valuable.
They said to make contact with them in any supergiant star system.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_10)
Our deep-space monitoring team has detected faint alien signals coming from
Uranus
or somewhere in that general direction.
The emanations are definitely being generated from within the solar system
and could represent the presence of a Hierarchy spy.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_11)
We have a major situation Captain!
As of a few days ago, all Spathi starship captains have vanished from our starbase.
We don't know how or why, but until we receive replacements from Spathiwa
you will be unable to commission any additional Spathi Eluder vessels for your fleet.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_12)
We are being bathed in broad-beam HyperWave transmission from the direction of the Rigel star system.
Due to the broadcast's wide dispersion, we cannot discern its content.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_13)
We have made a formal alliance with the Chmmr.
Their ships can now be built in our shipyards.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_14)
The Shofixti have returned!
Their ships can now be built in our shipyards.
With their vast numbers swelling our ranks
we won't have to worry about running out of able-bodied crew
and I'm sure their volunteers will reduce the cost for new crew.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_15)
We have detected a minute but measurable disturbance in the InterSpace fabric
at approximate TrueSpace coordinate 100:50.
Our scientists speculate that this disturbance may be caused by many thousands of HyperWarp penetrations
all in phase -- as though a huge fleet of ships were on the move.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_16)
In the log of your voyage from Unzervalt, I read that you encountered a tumbling,
red probe that attacked the Tobermoon, killing Captain Burton.
Over the past few months we have monitored an increasing number of these probes entering the system,
and I'm afraid their population seems to be growing geometrically.
If this continues, in a year space will be crawling with these things!
I recommend you treat this as a serious problem now, before it becomes a disaster.
Discover who is producing these probes and stop them from creating any more.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_18)
This seems strange to me, and I considered not bringing it up
but not long ago, six of my people fell unconscious simultaneously for no apparent reason.
When they awoke hours later, they reported being overwhelmed by a feeling
of something VERY wrong that had taken place.
The Med Techs couldn't find anything wrong with these crew members, but they discovered one correlation.
All six of them have exceptionally high esper ratings.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_19)
In the two weeks that have passed since the Chmmr began to work on your vessel
they attached the Utwig bomb to your ship, and have also put in place
their own crystalline amplification devices to boost dramatically the power of the weapon.
This work is now complete, and your flagship is ready for what ever final modifications you desire.
The Chmmr technicians wanted me to explain to you that the bomb and its crystal power boosters
are fragile and cannot be moved from their positions at the back of your vehicle.
Now I have some bad news, and some good news.
The Chmmr had to remove all your main modules, weapons, crew pods, and the whole lot
including your emergency warp escape unit
so pick your engagements carefully, Captain.
In addition, their equipment now fills the rear ten slots leaving you only six for your own modules.
But here's the good news
The Chmmr have provided us with an unbelievable wealth of minerals and other resources.
We no longer have limits on what we can build for your flagship, or your fleet.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_22)
I have some somber news.
For weeks now we have been scanning space in the direction of the Tucanae stars
hoping to hear some word from our Zoq-Fot-Pik allies,
with no success. We must assume that something grave has happened to them.
We did receive an alien broadcast however -- it rang through space like an electronic howl.
I think the best way to describe it would be
`exultant'.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_27)
Captain, I have an unpleasant topic to discuss with you, but this needs to be resolved right away.
There is some kind of wild rumor blowing around the starbase
that you have sold your own crew to the Druuge as slaves.
Pretty crazy, eh?
Look Captain, I know you would never do anything like that, and I'm sorry I even had to mention this
but now I can assure everyone that this is just one of those damn fool lies that gets spread during wartime.
Thank you for your patience, Captain.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_28)
I have just received incontrovertible evidence
that you HAVE been selling members of your own crew to the Druuge.
Captain, how could you!? Don't you know what the Druuge will use those men and women for?
Cannon-fodder, plain and simple. They are probably already dead, thanks to you.
It's a crime, Captain, a heinous crime -- even during wartime.
You must assure me that you will NEVER do this again!
Even with that assurance, great damage has been done.
With the word out on what you have done, it's going to be pretty damn hard to recruit volunteers
for your next trip.
I expect the RU cost for crew will sky-rocket.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_29)
Well Captain, we have another problem.
Your efforts on our behalf have been amazing, I truly believe we may win this struggle
but these achievements have not been gained without a price.
Over a thousand of my people have gone away with you on your ship
and not returned.
A THOUSAND, Captain!
Crew are quickly becoming a valuable commodity
and I expect their RU cost will reflect this.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_30)
I can't believe what I've just heard!
Captain, you're a heinous slave-trader!
Your exchanges with the Druuge have become a horror story throughout the entire starbase.
If anyone here is stupid enough to join your crew, I expect the RU cost will be sky high.
If you weren't our only hope for freedom, Captain, I'd kill you where you stand.
As it is, expect me to bring charges against you when this is all over.

#(DEVICE_HEAD)
The analysis reads as follows:

#(BETWEEN_DEVICES)
The next entry in the analysis is:

#(DEVICE_TAIL)
That's the end of our scientists' report.

#(ABOUT_PORTAL)
SUBJECT: QuasiSpace Portal Spawner.
DATA: Device is a hybrid of different alien technologies, including Arilou and Ur-Quan elements.
Our tests show that this device temporarily creates a weakness in the fabric between HyperSpace
and a different, unidentified dimension. The energy cost for this process is extreme
and since the unit's power supply is self-contained, we cannot estimate how long it will remain functional.
SUMMARY: Use of this device will permit a starship to make transit to a different dimension.
The hazards and benefits of this process are impossible to gauge without field study.

#(ABOUT_TALKPET)
SUBJECT: Talking Pet Lifeform.
DATA: This creature is physiologically identical to the so-called Ur-Quan `Talking Pet', with one notable exception:
It is highly intelligent, and evidences strong psychic capabilities.
Initial AIQR tests rated it well above human super-genius
though immediately after we made this shocking assessment
its scores dropped to the normal-sub-normal range.
Interviews with the subject have shown it to be cooperative
though a class-IV pan-species psychological profile places the creature far into the `Furtive-Hateful' domain.
There were also some disturbing incidents where
we talked about roses, daisies, and other pretty flowers!
SUMMARY: Everything's okay! Nothing to worry about with this cuddly little guy.
Not one thing!

#(ABOUT_BOMB)
SUBJECT: Utwig Bomb Device.
DATA: Analysis has yielded little information about this device
largely because of our technicians' unwillingness to open it, or even remove the bomb from your ship.
That aside, here's what we know so far:
The device is correctly defined as a Bomb... one of enormous destructive potential
but it is not of Utwig origin -- nothing about it relates to the technology we see in the Jugger ship.
We believe it to be of late Precursor origin
though it somewhat resembles certain Chenjesu technology.
Its original function? -- Probably a planeteering tool for dispersing unwanted moons.
SUMMARY: Unless there is a strong reason to do otherwise
DO NOT ACTIVATE THIS DEVICE! LEAVE IT ALONE!
Any experimentation should be conducted AT LEAST 12 AU from this starbase
and preferably a bit further.

#(ABOUT_SUN)
SUBJECT: Sun Device.
DATA: The unit contains a power generator whose output magnitude is simply mind-croggling.
When activated, the device radiates energy equivalent to less than 1/100 of 1% of our sun
however, when placed close to a planet, perhaps in orbit, its output would rival Sol's.
SUMMARY: Another Precursor tool, the energy output of which can replace or augment a sun's radiance.

#(ABOUT_MAIDENS)
SUBJECT: Shofixti Maidens.
DATA: Subjects appear to be 16 Shofixti females, all in young adulthood.
Subjects appear to be in good condition, with little or no freezer burn or other degeneration.
Hibernation maintenance units are functioning normally, and resuscitation equipment is easily activated.
SUMMARY: We can wake them, but why? What shall we tell them? That they are an extinct species?
Until such a time as we feel we can induce artificial parthenogenesis
or otherwise give the Shofixti sexual viability, our recommendation is to keep them as they are
asleep.

#(ABOUT_SPHERE)
SUBJECT: Rosy Sphere Device.
DATA: The specimen is 5 centimeters in diameter, perfectly smooth
and composed of a blood-red translucent substance.
Tests show that it has atypical ferro-magnetic properties, but is utterly non-conductive.
SUMMARY: Probably a Precursor tool -- function unknown.

#(ABOUT_HELIX)
SUBJECT: Aqua Helix Device.
DATA: This device is composed of a light blue, super-hard substance which rates Mohs-13.
The object is composed of a flat ribbon of homogenous material approximately 1 meter in length
and it is twisted in a perfect helix.
Focused ion and nucleo-magnetic scans reveal little about its interior.
SUMMARY: Unknown design. Unknown origin. Unknown function.

#(ABOUT_SPINDLE)
SUBJECT: Clear Spindle Device.
DATA: The object in question has no clear use or means of activation
but does have super-conductive characteristics between 18 and 22 degrees C.
We suspect that it is of Precursor manufacture, but we cannot be certain without extended study.
SUMMARY: In all likelihood, this object is a part of a larger device whose capabilities remain unknown.

#(ABOUT_ULTRON_0)
SUBJECT: Ultron Device.
We put this thing through every test we've got, and came up with the same results as if we'd used a fork
nothing, zero, zip.
If this thing ever functioned -- which we doubt -- it certainly won't now.
Age and physical stress have long since robbed it of whatever `mystical powers' it might have once had.
SUMMARY: In the future, please don't waste our valuable time on junk like this so-called `Ultron.'

#(ABOUT_ULTRON_1)
SUBJECT: Ultron Device.
DATA: At first we thought this was a piece of junk -- in fact it may still be just that
but when you submitted it to us, we infused it with gamma radiation
and found that the scatter signature was identical to the patterns
recorded from the `Empties', the `Singing Hoops', and `the Big Dud'
which were all found in Precursor burrows on Procyon.
SUMMARY: We are now convinced that this is a Precursor tool, but it remains dysfunctional.

#(ABOUT_ULTRON_2)
SUBJECT: Ultron Device.
DATA: The Ultron is partially functional, and we can detect energy emission from the device.
We suspect that the unit requires additional minor repairs before achieving full functionality
and at this time, we cannot make an assessment of its capabilities.
SUMMARY: A single additional replacement part should bring the Ultron to life.

#(ABOUT_ULTRON_3)
SUBJECT: Ultron.
DATA: We have determined that the so-called `Ultron' is in fact the `Appendages of Dawn'
described in the Precursor fragment found on Rigel in 2123.
In the partially translated Precursor text, the device is described as a `Mental Amplifier'
which focuses mental energies of the holder `for the purpose of discreet change'.
Unfortunately, human brain emanations do not seem compatible with the Ultron
nor do those of the allied species we have tested.
SUMMARY: Perhaps the Utwig, who claim to understand this device, can shed some light
on its true function and power.

#(ABOUT_UCASTER)
SUBJECT: HyperWave Broadcaster - Umgah Design.
DATA: This unit is capable of generating extremely intense HyperWave transmissions
though it is otherwise similar to our own `Casters.
SUMMARY: This thing would be great for practical jokes. You could scream `Boo!' from an Oort Cloud
and scare the pants, or whatever, off everyone in the system.
If you used it in HyperSpace, there's no telling who might hear you and come running.

#(ABOUT_BCASTER)
SUBJECT: HyperWave Broadcaster - Unknown Design.
DATA: This technology is new to us, but though a bit primitive by Alliance standards
is capable of generating a VERY strong signal.
SUMMARY: Should you wish to call someone in HyperSpace, or send a message through a mile of steel
this baby will do just fine.

#(ABOUT_SHIELD)
SUBJECT: Taalo Device.
DATA: Whoever the Taalo were, they were clever -- way past us, probably even beyond the Chenjesu.
As far as I can tell, with all our equipment, this thing is a rock.
Just a rock; nothing but a rock. However,
if you feed a current into it, anywhere along its surface
everyone on board this starbase who has esper potential gets a bad headache.
Well we checked a bit more into that, and when the Taalo thing is active
all evidence of psychon interaction is flatlined -- nothing gets through.
SUMMARY: If you keep this Taalo rock device thing on board your vessel
I'll bet you are immune to any form of psychic attack
or at least mostly immune.

#(ABOUT_EGGCASE_0)
SUBJECT: Mycon Egg Case.
DATA: We really didn't know Mycon came from eggs, but our analysis of this sheath
shows that it has been subjected to phenomenal temperatures and pressures.
The most unusual aspect of the egg case is its size
we know Mycons range in height from .5 to 3.5 meters
but our reconstruction of the whole egg case shows it to be over 25 meters high!
SUMMARY: If a Mycon came out of this, it's gotta be really big.

#(ABOUT_SHUTTLE)
SUBJECT: Syreen Pilot Shuttle.
DATA: As yet, the field research team has failed to report back to their group leaders.
When we called them, they described being deep in study
and wished to attend to a few important details before returning to the base.
SUMMARY: Several group leaders have volunteered to assist the team to `help them where they can.'

#(ABOUT_VUXBEAST0)
SUBJECT: Hostile Alien Creature.

#(ABOUT_VUXBEAST1)
DATA: This is newly-promoted, junior scientist Hawkins reporting.
Dr. Chu -- y'know, he's the leader of this section -- he's still in sick bay.
He's been there ever since that thing took a swipe at him and he got too close to the cage.
I guess it's got like, triple-jointed arms or something... with spikes and razor-plates all over.
Uh... data? Oh yeah, right, right
Subject is a Xenoteratomorph -- a big honkin' one, I might add.
It eats everything -- plants, animal tissue, wood
ceramics, plastics, asbestos fibers
several types of metal
chairs, a desk and about half of everything a security officer wears.
What is doesn't eat, it chews, and what it doesn't chew
well, it breaks up into tiny little pieces.
What... summary? Oh, oh yeah
SUMMARY: The sooner you get that thing off this starbase
the less likely it is that that thing will get loose and kill us all.
Uh... I, uh, I guess that's it.

#(ABOUT_DESTRUCT)
SUBJECT: Slylandro Probe Destruct Code Sequence.
DATA: This is a complex sequence of program instructions
using an encryption sequence similar in some ways to the Rolling-Phung algorithm.
SUMMARY: When a Slylandro Probe approaches, open a hailing frequency, wait for a response
and then transmit the code.

#(ABOUT_WARPPOD)
SUBJECT: Ur-Quan Warp Pod.
DATA: This unit appears to be the core for the starboard warp pod of an Ur-Quan Dreadnought.
It is surprisingly similar to our own warp cores
but it generates a much stronger, tighter field than the equipment we have on our Cruisers.
SUMMARY: For us, the Warp Pod is little more than a curiosity
though you may find some useful application for it in the future.

#(ABOUT_ARTIFACT_2)
SUBJECT: Wimbli's Trident Device.
DATA: I presume this device is named `Wimbli's Trident'
because of the name, `Wimbli', crudely etched into its base.
SUMMARY: To be honest, Captain, I believe that the Druuge robbed you blind.

#(ABOUT_ARTIFACT_3)
SUBJECT: Glowing Rod Device.
DATA: We had high hopes for this device, Captain, because of the constant, pulsing aura it generated.
However, I am afraid after investigating the object, and locating its concealed batteries slot
we had to conclude that this was nothing more than a well-crafted toy.
SUMMARY: In the future, Captain, I would be very careful of what I bought from the Druuge.

#(LETS_SEE)
Hmm... let's see...

#(GO_GET_MINERALS)
I guess I'd gather more minerals to build up a good supply of resource units.

#(IMPROVE_FLAGSHIP_WITH_RU)
Use the Resource Units you have accumulated to improve your flagship.

#(GOT_OK_FLAGSHIP)
Your flagship is in pretty good shape.

#(GO_ALLY_WITH_ALIENS)
You should investigate building alliances with non-hostile alien races.
Their assistance is crucial to our success.

#(MADE_SOME_ALLIES)
You have established several successful alliances with alien races.

#(GET_SHIPS_BY_MINING_OR_ALLIANCE)
Build up your fleet of combat vessels.
Their additional strength and the flexibility granted by their various powers
will greatly enhance your ability to survive in space.

#(GOT_OK_FLEET)
You've assembled a good-sized fleet of combat ships.

#(BUY_COMBAT_SHIPS)
You need to build combat escorts and assemble a fleet to accompany you through space.

#(GO_LEARN_ABOUT_URQUAN)
We must find a chink in the Ur-Quan's armor --
-- a weakness that will allow us to focus our strength in such a way
that we can destroy their entire empire in a single, bold stroke.

#(MAKE_FLAGSHIP_AWESOME)
My guess is you need to upgrade further your flagship
to make it more than a match for any enemy ship you might encounter.
You know the Ur-Quan's Achilles' heel -- their Sa-Matra super-starship.

#(KNOW_ABOUT_SAMATRA)
You know the Ur-Quan's Achilles' heel -- their Sa-Matra super-starship.

#(GOT_AWESOME_FLAGSHIP)
You have constructed a flagship of unrivaled power.

#(GOT_BOMB)
You've got the bomb from the Utwig.

#(FIND_WAY_TO_DESTROY_SAMATRA)
You must find some way to destroy the Ur-Quan supership, the Sa-Matra.

#(MUST_INCREASE_BOMB_STRENGTH)
Although the bomb you got from the Utwig is horrendously powerful,
I'm afraid our computer projections show that the explosion will not be sufficient
to break through the Sa-Matra's defenses.
You must find some way to increase the energy output of the weapon.
Perhaps the Chenjesu and their superior scientific knowledge could have done this,
but unfortunately, we do not currently possess the technology to achieve this modification.

#(MUST_ACQUIRE_AWESOME_FLEET)
I'm certain we need to assemble a more powerful fleet of combat ships before you face the Sa-Matra.

#(MUST_ELIMINATE_URQUAN_GUARDS)
You must figure out how to eliminate or destroy the Ur-Quan and Kohr-Ah ships guarding the Sa-Matra.

#(CHMMR_IMPROVED_BOMB)
The Chmmr have modified your ship to route its weapon power through the Utwig bomb.

#(GOT_AWESOME_FLEET)
You have amassed a powerful fleet of combat ships.

#(GO_DESTROY_SAMATRA)
Go attack the Ur-Quan Sa-Matra vessel!
Although I'm sure it will be a difficult battle,
you have everything you need to achieve victory.

#(GOOD_LUCK_AGAIN)
We're all depending on you.  Goodbye, and good luck.

#(IMPROVE_1)
You need to build up and balance the strength of your flagship.

#(IMPROVE_2)
My guess is you need to upgrade your flagship
to make it more than a match for any enemy ship you might encounter.

#(NEED_THRUSTERS_1)
I would add thrusters up to say, 5 or 6.
Speed is essential in combat, but it would also pay off over the long haul in HyperSpace
and if you prefer to avoid confrontation, nothing beats a great pair of legs.

#(NEED_THRUSTERS_2)
I would maximize your ship's thrusters. You will need speed when you confront the Ur-Quan.

#(NEED_TURN_1)
I would add turning jets for increased maneuverability.

#(NEED_TURN_2)
I would maximize rotation speed by filling your turning jet slots.

#(NEED_GUNS_1)
I would add enough weapons to defend yourself if you are caught without escort ships.

#(NEED_GUNS_2)
I would take advantage of your ship's capacity for combat by increasing its firepower.
Add more weaponry.

#(NEED_CREW_1)
You need more crew, at least 50, to make productive voyages into space.

#(NEED_CREW_2)
You need even more crew, perhaps as many as 200, to face the challenges ahead.

#(NEED_FUEL_1)
You need additional fuel, at least 50 units.

#(NEED_FUEL_2)
You need large quantities of fuel, at least 150 units.

#(NEED_STORAGE_1)
Increase your cargo capacity by adding more Storage Bays to your flagship.

#(NEED_LANDERS_2)
You need at least one lander.

#(NEED_LANDERS_1)
Build more landers.

#(NEED_DYNAMOS_1)
Your weapons will be underpowered in combat if you don't have at least 1 dynamo.

#(NEED_DYNAMOS_2)
You need more dynamo power;
otherwise your weapon re-energizing delays will be your undoing in combat.

#(NEED_POINT)
I suggest you invest in one or more point-defense laser systems.

#(have_minerals)
Commander, I have minerals to offload.

#(goodbye_commander)
Goodbye, Commander.

#(repeat_bulletins)
