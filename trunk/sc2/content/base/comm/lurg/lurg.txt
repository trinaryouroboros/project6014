#(LURG_HOME_HELLO_1)	LURG_HOME_HELLO_1.ogg
I'm impressed you've made it this far, human-flesh.
Now leave or be destroyed.

#(LURG_SPACE_HELLO_1)	LURG_SPACE_HELLO_1.ogg
Well, human-flesh, I see you have finally wandered into this region of space. 
It was a only a matter of time, but this intrusion into Lurg space cannot be allowed.
For this, you must die.

#(we_mean_no_harm)
I assure you, we mean you no harm. As a gesture of good will we leave the way we came.

#(distress_call)
We are on a rescue mission. A distress call was sent by one of our Allies, we must be allowed to pass.

#(suck_vacuum)
Prepare to suck vacuum, you hideous space slug!

#(CANT_LEAVE)	LURG_CANT_LEAVE.ogg
You cannot be permitted to leave, human. Here you will die.

#(DONT_INSULT_US)	LURG_DONT_INSULT_US.ogg
Human-flesh, do not insult me. We know exactly who you are
the famous Vela hero who defeated the Ur-Quan Sa-Matra.
We know why you are here. You cannot leave alive.

#(let_us_pass)
Ah. I see my reputation proceeds me. Well, then you know I'm not bluffing. Let us pass.

#(can_we_pass)
Please. I implore you. Let us pass peacefully. We mean no harm.

#(tell_us_stuff)
Before we get to the fighting, can you answer some questions for us?

#(CANT_PASS)	LURG_CANT_PASS.ogg
You shall not pass.

#(ASK_YOUR_QUESTIONS)	LURG_ASK_YOUR_QUESTIONS.ogg
Always the curious ape. Ask your questions.

#(tellus_species)
What can you tell us about your species?

#(tellus_ship)
What can you tell us about your ship?

#(tellus_shielded)
Why weren't you slave shielded by the Ur-Quan?

#(we_are_peaceful)
If you know us, don't you know we only want peace?

#(dont_tellus)
I think I'm done with the questions.

#(URQUAN_ALLIANCE)	LURG_URQUAN_ALLIANCE.ogg
The Ur-Quan knew it would be a fatal mistake to fight against us,
so they did wisely to ignore us.

#(NOT_PEACEFUL)	LURG_NOT_PEACEFUL.ogg
Humans, peaceful? Is that what you really think?
When the rest of humanity was locked inside a slave shield
and had but the meager resources of your Earth
your species practically killed each other fighting over the scraps.
You would surely have died within two generations
had you not been emancipated by the Chmmr.

#(OUR_SPECIES)	LURG_OUR_SPECIES.ogg
We are the Lurg. 

#(OUR_SHIP)	LURG_OUR_SHIP.ogg
The Lurg Prawn is a lower lifeform, genetically altered
designed by us to survive in the void of space.

#(you_look_familiar) 
You look strangely familiar. You have a face I don't think I'd forget.

#(YOU_FEEL_US)	LURG_YOU_FEEL_US.ogg
You can feel it in the back of your mind, can't you
somehow, you've always felt we were watching you.
We know more about you than you can possibly imagine
hero of Sa-Matra.

#(alien_stalkers)
Oh. Great. I'm so famous, I got alien stalkers now or something?!

#(creepy)
Oh. That's not creepy at all.

#(big_imagination)
I don't know, I can imagine quite a lot.

#(WE_KNOW_ALL)	LURG_WE_KNOW_ALL.ogg
We make it our business to know. Knowledge is power. That is all you need to know.

#(we_kick_ass)
Look. We kicked the Ur-Quan's butt; well, butt equivalent. Why should we be scared of you?

#(we_are_powerful)
I warn you. We can be a powerful enemy. Surely there is a peaceful way out of this.

#(EASILY_DESTROYED)	LURG_EASILY_DESTROYED.ogg
Human-flesh, you are not as powerful as you'd like to believe.
If we wanted you dead, we could have let the Mycon
destroy your world a thousand years ago.
You are nothing to us.

#(last_chance)
This is your last chance for a peaceful resolution, Lurg.

#(lets_fight)
Okay. Is this the part where we fight now?

#(GOODBYE)	LURG_GOODBYE.ogg
Now it is time for you to die.
Even if you run, you will help spread our message.
Too long we have ignored this sector of space.
Let it be known, the Lurg are back.
