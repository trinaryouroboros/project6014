#(LURG_HOME_HELLO_1)
I'm impressed Captain you've made it this far. Now leave or be destroyed.

#(LURG_SPACE_HELLO_1)
Well, Captain I see you have finally wandered in this region of space. 
It was a only a matter of time, but this intrusion into Lurg space cannot be allowed. 
For this, you must die.

#(we_mean_no_harm)
I assure you, we mean you no harm. As a gesture of good will, we will leave the way we came.

#(distress_call)
We are on a rescue mission. A distress call was sent by one of our Allies, we must be allowed to pass.

#(suck_vacuum)
Prepare to suck vacuum you hideous space slug!

#(CANT_LEAVE)
You cannot be permitted to leave Captain. Here. You will die.

#(DONT_INSULT_US)
Earthling, do not insult me. We know exactly who you are. The famous Unzervault Hero who defeated the Ur-Quan Sa Matra.
We know why you are here. You cannot leave alive.

#(let_us_pass)
Ah. I see my reputation proceeds me. Well, then you know, I’m not bluffing, let us pass or you will be the ones dying.

#(can_we_pass)
Please. I implore you. Let us pass peacefully. We mean no harm.

#(tell_us_stuff)
Before we get to the fighting, can you answer some questions for us?

#(CANT_PASS)
You shall not pass.

#(ASK_YOUR_QUESTIONS)
Always the curious Ape. Ask your questions.

#(tellus_species)
What can you tell us about your species?

#(tellus_ship)
What can you tell us about your ship?

#(tellus_shielded)
Why weren't you slave shielded by the Ur-Quan?

#(we_are_peaceful)
If you know us, don't you know we only want peace?

#(dont_tellus)
I think I'm done with the questions.

#(URQUAN_ALLIANCE)
The Ur-Quan knew it would be a fatal mistake to fight against us. So, they ignored us.

#(NOT_PEACEFUL)
Humans, peaceful? Is that what you really think?  
When the rest of humanity was locked inside a slave shield, and had the resources of a single planet, 
your species practically destroyed each other fighting each other. 
If it hadn't been for your colony being lost, humans would have surely destroyed themselves.

#(OUR_SPECIES)
We are the Lurg. 

#(OUR_SHIP)
The Lurg Prawn is a genetically altered lifeform designed by us to live even in the harshest environments.

#(you_look_familiar) 
You look strangely familiar. But, you have a face I don't think I'd forget.

#(YOU_FEEL_US)
You can feel it in the back of your mind, can't you? Somehow, you've always felt we were watching you.
We know more about you than you can possibly imagine Captain.

#(alien_stalkers)
Oh. Great. I'm so famous, I got alien stalkers now or something?!

#(creepy)
Oh. That's not creepy at all.

#(big_imagination)
I don't know, I can imagine quite a lot.

#(WE_KNOW_ALL)
We make it our business to know. Knowledge is power. That is all you need to know.

#(we_kick_ass)
Look. We kicked the Ur-Quan's butt, well butt equivalent. And now, we are at your front door. Why should we be scared of you?

#(we_are_powerful)
I warn you. We can be a powerful enemy. Surely there is a peaceful way out of this.

#(EASILY_DESTROYED)
Captain, you are not as powerful as you'd like to believe. 
If we wanted you dead, we could have let the Mycon destroy your world a thousand years ago. 
You are nothing to us.

#(last_chance)
This is your last chance for a peaceful resolution or we will fight you.

#(lets_fight)
Okay. Is this the part where we fight now?

#(GOODBYE)
Now it is time for you to die.
Even if you run, you will help spread our message.  
Too long we have ignore this sector of space. 
Let it be known, the Lurg are back.
