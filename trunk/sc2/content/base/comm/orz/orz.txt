#(ORZ_GREETING)	ORZ_GREETING.ogg
This $*now*$ is $*smiley*$ like $*lizards*$! $*Camper*$ captain has to see the Orz!
$*Happy campers*$ can say Hello to Orz every day. 
I say three times more than $*bottom*$:
"Hello $*Camper*$ friends!"

#(ORZ_GREETING_2)	ORZ_GREETING_2.ogg
$*Jumping Peppers!*$ Again $*campers*$ are to make talk with us the Orz.
Do we $*play*$ this $*game*$? We do, and do not $*hurt*$ in the $*during*$!

#(how_are_things)
How are things?

#(HAPPY_ORZ)	HAPPY_ORZ.ogg
Before now is $*fun time*$, and Orz can make $*games*$ with $*campers*$
and $*smell colours*$ and even the $*Playground*$.
Soon is so more $*unbeamy*$ and $*inferior poets*$ $*spread*$ into $*camper*$ $*basis*$
to $*vulcanize*$ and even $*leap*$!
Orz are dancing $*inferior poets*$ before, after and soon, but not $*good to go*$!
Orz $*paint the town*$ everyday but $*fingers*$ have $*right of way*$
and when $*inferior poets*$ are $*vulcanizing*$ we have to go $*below*$.
If you are $*freak out!*$, Orz can $*pull*$ $*campers*$ to the $*outside*$.
$*Inferior poets*$ are most the $*inside*$, $*outside*$ not so.

#(any_news)
Can you give us any news?

#(ORZ_NEWS)	ORZ_NEWS.ogg
Since several $*pieces*$ we are learning the $*happy camper*$ favourite $*games*$
and extoll the $*numbers*$ that are $*ripe*$.
About this $*level*$ the $*Silly Cows*$ and $*campers*$ $*spit*$ the first words otherwise.
VUX are $*Sad Animals*$ and always say to know the Orz or be $*dissolving*$.
VUX are always $*dancing*$ the Orz but not better than small, so not so $*frumple*$ any sooner.

#(tell_of_nature)
Please, tell me of your true nature.

#(ORZ_TELL_1)	ORZ_TELL_1.ogg
I am say so much, and then less more:
Before $*campers*$ first said "Hello!" the Orz there was Androsynth.
The Androsynth made $*slippery places*$ for us to $*smell*$ your $*level*$
and we find the $*New Town*$ and the $*Playgrounds*$.
This is the everything story, and already you know.
If $*campers*$ know bigger than the everything story Orz are $*pulling*$ the $*campers*$.
Orz are $*pulling*$ the $*silly*$ Androsynth and they do not like.
$*Campers*$ are not ready and do not want!!
The everything story is enough to $*open*$ the $*party*$ $*door*$, but do not spill the drinks.
I am joke on party and $*party*$. It is funny the most, even not too $*false*$ enough for $*spices*$!

#(tell_buddies)
Probably time you told your buddies what really happened to the Androsynth don't you think?

#(ORZ_TELL_2)	ORZ_TELL_2.ogg
No!! You do not want to know! I am clear and you do not ask so much the $*fat*$ words!
Now you understand, we can $*hammer*$ the $*tulips*$ together.
No more ask the true nature.

#(discuss_alliance_matters)
We need to discuss Alliance matters...

#(HAPPY_TO_DISCUSS)	HAPPY_TO_DISCUSS.ogg
If $*campers*$ need to converse on the Alliance, that is okay.
Do not be frighten to ask the Orz,
"What is up?" We now understand the words.
Think, once we mistake the meaning for the words $*apart*$.
It so funny, when we know that $*together*$ is different from $*apart*$!
I laughed and laughed.
What is Alliance matters now?

#(alliance_question_1)
Are you happy with your established sphere of influence?

#(alliance_question_2)
The Syreen are an awful lot like us humans... and some other guys we know. What do you think?

#(ALLIANCE_ANSWER_1)	ALLIANCE_ANSWER_1.ogg
The $*square*$ machines draw $*limits*$ in $*heavy space*$.
The machines want to contain $*Orz bubbles*$. They afraid of $*Orz bubbles*$.
Such a joke! This is all the more fun! $*Orz bubbles*$ are not Orz, just $*fingers*$ of Orz.
You cannot contain $*fingers*$, so silly! We just $*slip*$ and poke and reach. 
We make a $*peephole*$ in $*the middle*$. Orz is again $*expanding*$.
More and more $*expanding*$!

#(ALLIANCE_ANSWER_2)	ALLIANCE_ANSWER_2.ogg
The $*slow pixies*$ draw Orz closer.
But now Orz just $*sweeping*$ the $*house*$.

#(enough_alliance)
That's enough about alliance for now.

#(ENOUGH_ALLIANCE_OK)	ENOUGH_ALLIANCE_OK.ogg
Never be afraid to $*open*$ enough and $*spread the wax*$.

#(ask_know_fjorn)
Do you know anything about the Fjorn?

#(ORZ_DENY_FJORN)	ORZ_DENY_FJORN.ogg
It is not. Orz have never hear this word "Fjorn".
It is strange because Orz have hear most words and many people, but not $*talker*$ Fjorn.

#(you_have_met_fjorn)
Talker Fjorn? So you have met them!

#(TALK_ABOUT_FJORN)	TALK_ABOUT_FJORN.ogg
Since $*Campers*$ are last ask Orz have meet $*talker*$ Fjorn again.
Fjorn are $*happy*$ but after too much time are not $*happy*$, are not $*enjoy*$ and talk like not stopping!

#(any_more_news)
Any more news for us?

#(ORZ_GARBAGE)	ORZ_GARBAGE.ogg
Have you $*pursue*$ the $*light temperature*$ yet?
Before it has been so not for you but $*tomorrow*$ you saw.
Maybe you even do not know? Do not worry.
Perhaps we can help you the $*light temperature*$.
$*Light temperature*$ is very good for $*playing*$ $*spicy*$ $*games*$.
When $*campers*$ make $*shiny music*$ for all $*directions*$
then $*light temperature*$ is not so $*distant*$.
$*Anticipation*$ of $*fun times*$ are the $*lightest*$ $*game*$.
$*Games*$ soon are $*heavy*$, but $*light temperature*$ is still $*appropriate*$.

#(goodbye_orz)
Thank you Orz, we must be off!

#(GOODBYE_EARTHLING)	GOODBYE_EARTHLING.ogg
Orz must be $*on*$. Only joke!
