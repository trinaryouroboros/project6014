#(WONDERFUL)
I trust you don't mind my bypassing regular channels to talk to you directly.
It is wonderful to see you again.

#(MMMM)
Mmmmmmmmm... mMMMMMmmm
mrrrrr... m...
mmmmmmmm

#(WELCOME_BACK)
Welcome back to Ruttipeep, the home of all Yehat and Pkunk.
Well, most of them, usually.
Some of them, often?
These days it seems like it's a few, on occasion.

#(HOWDY)
Howdy-lowdy-to-you!
I like these visits of yours because I can really let loose.
When I say darn near anything that's just happy around here,
everyone becomes quite confused and a bit worried.
It's quite off-putting.
I have a very private room that used to be used for dark conspiracies
and I just shout for joy in it!
A much better use for the room, for sure.

#(did_we_speak)
Did we speak back at Gamma Kreuger?

#(ONE_AS_ALL)
In a way, yes.
We spoke from the heart there, all as one, one speaking as all. I spoke to you then, from my heart, though I wasn't really aware of it at the time, and I'm not sure what we said.
But yes, we did.

#(astral)
I presume you mean astral vision or such, right? Because we've never met.

#(PHOTOGRAPHS)
Photographs, actually. It's much nicer in person, though, isn't it?
And don't say it - I know you're around eight million wingspans from here.
You're such a joker.

#(nicee)
It is nice to meet you at last, your majesty.

#(ADAPT)
Majesty. Yes, it's quite a change of situation, isn't it?
I'm adapting, though. That's what life does, does it not?
A little change - adapt!
Another little change - adapt adapt!
A biiig change?
Go extinct, mostly...
but some adapt!

#(thanks)
Thank you for coming to our aid in the battle against the Sa-Matra.

#(GUIDANCE)
Yes, yes.
That was quite important.
And thank you for your guidance on the timing of our return.

#(how_queen)
How did you end up queen?

#(REBEL_RANT)
The rebel clans' main victories were moral and with words.
The people yearned for change, but rebellion was unacceptable
and asking nicely didn't look like it would get very far
which put them in a bit of a tight spot, right?
It got to the point that the loyalists weren't so much loyal to the queen
as against the idea that rebellion was a good way of changing government.
But the queen was absolute... so no one could say that.
In the end, they just agreed to make someone queen, while skipping the rebellion step.
I'm not sure how that part works
and neither are they.
And who better than someone truly neutral in that fight?
Someone reasonably coherent, conciliatory, very photogenic
and who maintains all of those while having the tar beaten out of her.
So, in the span of a day I went from little old Braky Girdy, inmate number something-or-other
to Braky Girdy the First,
and that's quite a difference, let me tell you!

#(how_is_it)
How's queenship treating you?

#(SYMBOL)
It's not really about me, is it?
The clans need a symbol to unite them.
A symbol that happens to wield absolute executive power.
I do what needs to be done, and don't do the other things.
Mainly, what needs to be done is to figure out what needs to be done.
It's getting harder now that people know
no matter how far I have my head in the clouds,
I'm hard to fool.
I didn't get where I was among the Pkunk by tolerating phoniness!
There is quite a lot of that around these days.

#(court)
Let's talk about the goings-on at court again.

#(CANT)
It always comes back to that, doesn't it?
I can hardly express an opinion without thinking about someone's going to interpret it.

#(nafs)
What do you think of the way the New Alliance of Free Stars is working out?

#(WAY_BETTER)
What do I think?
It's waaay better than utter annihilation.
Not even close!
The way we're being sidelined by the Chmmr is just a snip of bitter root in the stew of life.
I would very much have loved to engage with the VUX and treat them with the love they need
to be free of their negativity...
but not to be.
And the Mycon, well, as long as the planets they're... rearranging...
aren't inhabited, well, they can do their thing too!
Sure, they're a bit rough around the edges, could use a touch more loving kindness
and consideration of the needs of others,
but nobody's perfect.
Some in this court welcomed these decisions.
But you may know, captain, that whatever happens, whoever you offend, and no matter the rules,
as long as you look out for those on the bottom, as long as your compromises have heart,
you're our friend.
You're welcome here even if you don't do those things
though we'll be somewhat less enthusiastic.

#(need_help)
I could use some help. And I don't mean love.


#(COSMOLOGY)
Certainly!
The first thing to understand is that there is more than one universe.
Not an infinite number, but quite a few.
And many of them are in little groups, each related to the others in a sequence.
Our world is in one of these.
And in a later *version*, I will be able to give you more concrete advice.
But with the wind as it is, this meta-cosmology lesson is all I have to offer.

#(spanish)
Hasta la vista!

#(ADIOS1)
Adios, huma√±os.
...
Is that right? I'm not even sure that's the same lan-

#(ADIOS2)
Adios, humanos!

#(queen_different)
So, being queen is a bit different from... whatever it was you were before?

#(ADAPT2)
Hoody-my-bee, yes it is!
I'm adapting, though. That's what life does, does it not?
A little change - adapt!
Another little change - adapt adapt!
A biiig change?
Go extinct, mostly...
but some adapt!

#(court_troubles)
What are these courtly troubles?

#(COURT_SHIT)
This and that. Factionalism, xenophobia,
turning a blind eye to the needy,
refusal to consider alternatives,
and, most troubling to the peers, perversion of honor.
Nothing we haven't all lived with for as long as our respective species have been sapient.
Court is a bit like wading through mud.
You can do it with flat wide feet, or long thin legs
I go with the long thin legs, myself.
You could also wear a wetsuit.
Maybe that's more of what I'm doing.
Sometimes you just wish you could exorcise the whole lot of it
but these demons belong here. They're ours. The outer darkness can't have 'em!

#(me_help)
Is there anything I can do to help?

#(SAVE_WORLD)
Hmm.
On this?
Not that I know of.
Please, though, do prevent the destruction of all life in the galaxy.
That would be dreadfully inconvenient.

#(you_busy)
You sound terribly busy.

#(ME_BUSY)
Somewhat busy. The most important part is finding good people
and the second most important part is trusting them.
That's hard.
But you have to do it!
We're all children before the cosmos
and nothing's worse than some brat who thinks she can run everyone else's lives.
A perspective like that helps, as a queen.

#(interesting)
That was interesting.

#(MELTINGPOT)
It's not half as interesting to hear the description
as it is to actually sniff the stew of mixing cultures.
To guide and learn and find things out
to squinnet out the liars and expose them to the light of day
- for their own good of course - 
and ride the updraft of civilization as far as we can.
As awful as things can get, you always need to look up.

#(JOKE)
Say, I heard one of your human jokes. Would you like to hear it?
So, it goes
A rabbi, a Nietzchean transhumanist, and a length of rope walk into a bar
on a damaged spaceship that's about to crash
No, wait.
The rabbi is dyslexic.
Hmm... or was it Spinoza, instead of the rope?

#(wtf_joke)
What is this... I don't even...

#(PHILO_JOKE)
... think it's a joke! You're right, maybe I drowsed off
and mixed up your philosophical tracts with your science fiction novels.
Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference.

#(brick)
That one only works as a brick joke after the one where Saint Anselm brings Robert Dawkins a teapot.

#(YOU_KNOW_ALL)
Oh, right! Well, it seems you know it already.

#(delivery)
Your delivery could use some work.

#(THINGS_NOT_RIGHT)
It's not the only thing.
Sometimes I get the feeling things are not quite right around here.

#(important)
So, I had some more important matters to speak of.

#(BUSINESS)
Ah, yes. Business.
I get a lot of that, these days.

#(coming_out)
Umm, I hate to break it to you, but I was making it all up.

#(YOU_WERE_RIGHT)
Of course you were. Yet your heart was in the right place,
and, of course, you were right. The Yehat were not ready then.
Our visions grew cloudy and we knew the time was soonish, and did not want to be late.
When it came closer... it took your warning to get us off the wrong path.

#(ouija)
You're welcome to the use of my Ouija Board any time, your majesty.

#(EXCUSE)
Ah - hee! A joker!
Next you'll be telling me the month of the bloody moon is coming up.
I didn't hatch yesterday, you know.
I was looking for an excuse to turn that fleet around just then.

#(glad)
I'm glad it was helpful.

#(WELL_MEANT)
It was well meant, captain, and it did help.

#(uh_hi)
Uh, hi. You know you're broadcasting, right?

#(MMM)
mmm
mmmmmmmmm

#(yes_mmm)
Was that a 'yes' mmm, or a 'no' mmm?

#(MMMUUU)
mmmmuuuu
ptch! *cough* Ahmmmmmmm

#(see_me)
I know you can see me.

#(MMMMMM)
Mmmmmmmm

#(mm)
Mmmmmmmmmm

#(MREORM)
mmmmmrrrrrreeeeee
oooooooooooooo
rrrrrmmmmmmm

#(later)
I guess I'll come back later, or something.

#(MMM_EXIT)
mmmmmmmmmmmm
