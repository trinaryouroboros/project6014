#(MOOSY_GREETING)
Sorry handsome, but your princess is in another castle.

#(holy_crap)
Yeah my girlfriend used to work here and I was just being nostalgic... Holy Crap! I mean, uhh... Greetings. 

#(am_i_lost)
Whoa. Am I lost? This is the Syreen homeworld, right?

#(had_to_stop_by)
Talana asked I stop by to say "hi".

#(MOOSY_SAYS_HI)
Awww. Isn't she just a sweetheart? You tell her Moosy says "Hi".

#(i_ll_tell_her)
Alright... Moosy. I'll tell her.

#(perfect_name)
Moosy? Ha! What a perfect name. Err...a lovely name.

#(THANKS_SUGAR) 
Why Thank you sugar! 

#(YOU_CUTIE)
Sugar, she was right about you. You are a cutie.

#(TALK_TO_COMMANDER)
Sure is! I suggest you talk to the Syreen Commander on the planet below for any questions. 

#(huge_fan)
BIG fan of the Syreen. Err... No, huge Fan. I mean, Syreen are awesome.

#(JEALOUS)
Well, the Syreen are big fans of you Captain. 
Frankly, the story of the handsome captain who freed us from the Ur-Quan made many Syreen jealous of Talana.

#(not_hot)
I thought all Syreen were supposed to be hot! No offense.

#(MUCH_WOMAN)
None taken. Not everybody can handle this much woman. Your loss Captain. Most Syreen are skinny.

#(must_be_going)
Well, ummm, I really must be going now.

#(COME_BACK_ANYTIME_MOOSY)
Come back anytime sugar!
