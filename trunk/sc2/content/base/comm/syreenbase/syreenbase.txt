#(SYREEN_GREETING1)
Sorry handsome, but your princess is in another castle.


#(because_we_can)
Yeah my girlfriend used to work here and I was just being nostalgic... Holy Crap! I mean, uhh... Greetings. 

#(looking_for_artefacts)
Whoa. Am I lost? This is the Syreen homeworld, right?

#(spacebabes)
Talana asked I stop by to say "hi".

#(NICE_TUG)
Awww. Isn't she just a sweetheart? You tell her Moosy says "Hi".

#(thanks_tug_complement)
Alright... Moosy. I'll tell her.

#(not_fooled)
Moosy? Ha! What a perfect name. Err...a lovely name.

#(DOUBLE_WHATNOW) 
Why Thank you sugar! 

#(SURE_I_WAS)
Sugar, she was right about you. You are a cutie.

#(ANY_ASSISTANCE)
Sure is! I suggest you talk to the Syreen Commander on the planet below for any questions. 

#(roam_stars)
BIG fan of the Syreen. Err... No, huge Fan. I mean, Syreen are awesome.

#(WE_DONT_STRAY)
Well, the Syreen are big fans of you Captain. 
Frankly, the story of the handsome captain who freed us from the Ur-Quan made many Syreen jealous of Talana.

#(any_news)
I thought all Syreen were supposed to be hot! No offense.

#(NO_NEWS)
None taken. Not everybody can handle this much woman. Your loss Captain. Most Syreen are skinny.

#(spot_you_later)
Well, ummm, I really must be going now.

#(COME_BACK_ANYTIME)
Come back anytime sugar!
