#(SHO_GREETING1)
On behalf of the Shofixti, I bid you welcome Captain.
I feel I must apologize for the mess. 
You see, we're trying to rebuild 
our entire civilization.

#(SHO_GREETING2)
Welcome back Captain.

#(a_woman)
I've never met a female Shofixti! Well, except for some frozen ones.

#(YES_WOMAN)
Well, our culture dictates that women stay at home.
Not that I'm upset about it.

#(i_luv_furries)
Hey baby. You're kind of cute for a space dog.

#(BACK_OFF_CREEP)
Captain, with a due respect
By your standards, I may be young, and I may be small
but if you try to harass me again,
I'll kick your butt so hard it will make a Glory Device look like a firecracker.

#(you_sound_upset)
You sure? You sound upset about it.

#(glad_youre_not_upset)
Well, I'm glad you're not upset about it.

#(SINCE_YOU_MENTIONED_IT)
Well, now that you mention it
The Shofixti males go flying around,
looking for fights, and when they find one
they just end up just blowing themselves up!
Really? Is that really the best way settle a fight?
While the women must stay home, and run everything.
Government, manufacturing, food, all done by females.
Shofixti men are loving, noble creatures, fearsome fighters
but they are also stupid. 

#(thats_sad)
I didn't think about it that way. I understand your heavy burden.

#(humans_are_different)
Humans are different. You should follow our example.

#(SO_DIFFERENT)
Oh really? Tell me, where is your mate?

#(YOU_UNDERSTAND)
You do? A truly enlightened male! I'm sure your mate is with you now.

#(gf_at_home)
Actually.... she's back home on Unzervault. Taking care of our things there.

#(YOURE_JUST_AS_BAD)
...
I see.

#(DIFFERENT_INDEED)
Oh yes. Different indeed.

#(just_joking)
Sorry! You Shofixti can't take a joke! 

#(sorry_disrespectful)
I don't know what got into me. I apologize.

#(JUST_JOKING_REPLY)
Or perhaps your jokes need to be better.

#(DISRESPECTFUL_REPLY)
Well since you did save our civilization from extinction,
I guess I can forgive you. Apology accepted.

#(tell_me_about_distress_call)
Is there any information you can give me about the lost patrol's distress call.

#(DISTRESS_CALL)
I cannot comment on matters on which I don't know. 
I suggest contacting some of the Shofixti males.
You can find them easily.
They're the ones patrolling this area just looking for a fight.
Oh sure, they say they are looking for a new world for us.
But they're also looking for a fight. Be careful.

#(goodbye)
Ohh... look at the time! I really must be going.

#(GOODBYE_CAPTAIN)
Goodbye, Captain.
