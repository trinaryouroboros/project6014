#(INIT_HELLO)	
Attention, we cannot identify your race or your vessel. 
We are the SlaveRace. Who are you and where have you come from

#(we_are)
I am Earthling Captain Zelnick of the Starship xxx. I represent the New Alliance of Free Stars. We have travelled from Sol.

#(ARE_YOU_ALLIANCE)	
Is this the Alliance of the Chenjesu? We have heard of this. 
The Chenjesu contacted us many years ago warning of a horde of enslaving aliens. 
It appears that they never considered us threatened as they did not sustain communications with us.

#(worst_nightmare)
I'm your worst nightmare! Let's fight!

#(BRING_IT_ON)
Bring it on, bitch!

#(sort_of)
Sort of, this is the NEW Alliance of Free Stars. 
Most of the same guys, but no more Chenjesu, they have become the Chmmr.

#(master_of_the_galaxy)
We are the new masters of the galaxy, don't you know! Submit to our will or be destroyed!

#(SOVEREIGNTY)
If it is our sovereignty that interests you I suggest you speak to our masters the MasterRace. They might have something to say about your claims on this sector.

#(WHY_ARE_YOU_HERE)
What brings you to our space Earthling?

#(looking_for_assistance)
We are searching this region of space for assistance in our struggle to fight a new alien menace. Can you help?

#(were_lost)
We're lost. Can we use your phone?

#(looking_for_artefacts)
We are searching for Precursor Artefacts. Have you noticed any strange phenomenon or energy readings on the planets in this area?


#(CANNOT_ASSIST)	
We cannot assist you. 
Our foreign diplomacy is controlled by the MasterRace.

#(where_is_masterrace)
Okay then, so where do I find those people?

#(MASTERRACE_AT)
Their homeworld is at Beta Apollonius. They will be very interested in making contact I'm sure.

#(goodbye_slaverace)
We will leave you now.

#(GOODBYE_EARTHLING)
Until next time Earthling.
