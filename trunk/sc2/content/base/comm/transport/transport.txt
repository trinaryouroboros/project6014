#(GREETINGS_1)
Howdy, partner! This is your generic,
friendly neighborhood transport freighter.

#(GREETINGS_2)
How nice of you to drop by
the life of a freighter captain sure can use some surprises. 

#(GREETINGS_3)
Well, hola! Anything a poor, humble freighter can do for you?

#(GREETINGS_4)
Hello, captain. A slow, tardy, disinteresting, disintegrating,
rusty, musty and dusty transport ship salutes you.

#(whats_up)
What's up right now, freightmaster?

#(WAITING_FOR_LEAVE_1)
Loading cargo for the next run. You wouldn't happen to have
any splatter holo-vids to spare? It's gonna be a loooong trip.

#(WAITING_FOR_LEAVE_2)
Still packing up the shipment.
The containers would be coming up quite nicely
if it just wasn't for those darn cargo cyborgs that
'are supposed replace human workforce any time now'. 
Man, I hate those cyborgs!

#(WAITING_FOR_LEAVE_3)
Waiting for departure. 
Did you know that you can actually see the
New Great Wall when the Earth is in just the right angle
and if you squint real hard?

#(what_cargo)
Got something interesting in those containers?

#(CARGO_INIT)
Among others...

#(CARGO_1)
Highly refined petro-chemical products.
Did you know we're going to run out of this stuff
in, like, 50 years or so?

#(CARGO_2)
Flintlocks, Ovaltine, rubber overalls and cryogenized mutton
don't ask.

#(CARGO_3)
Assorted anti-matter weaponry, a selection of mass-drivers, 
containerful of pulse rifles, finest subrepeating blasters, 
fifty crates of gamma-ray mines, and one phase transit cannon.
...Wanna try?

#(CARGO_4)
Earthen silicon and crystal materials for
some egg-head researchers to spend their nights on.

#(CARGO_5)
Vaporware, baby.
Vaporware from the factories of Treedirelms!

#(CARGO_6)
Fuel supplies of various flavors.

#(CARGO_7)
Cultural artefacts and rarities from Earth.
20th century land-based sport cars and
pine trees have been fetching top prices of late!

#(CARGO_8)
Tons of precious and not-so precious metals.

#(CARGO_9)
Fusion lanterns, exotic fruits, electrobinoculars
and adhesives. Most importantly, adhesives!

#(CARGO_10)
A very large arboreal herd animal.
(Chopped up.)

#(CARGO_11)
Vacuum-packed insurance salesmen
prepared to take over the world.

#(CARGO_12)
Weather computers, holocorders, artificial intelligences
all that cheap, mass-produced Sino-Japanese crap.

#(LEAVING_1)
Great news! 
The writing's on the wall!
The world is holding it's breath in awe!
Pkunk droppings are hitting the fan in heaps!
The freight run has started! We are leaving for hyperspace!

#(LEAVING_2)
All aboard! This freight train has started!
For the next couple of weeks hang tight to your underwear
it's going to be the slowest trip in the history!

#(HYPERSPACE_1)
We're making a good headway. The freight is safe and sound.

#(HYPERSPACE_2)
This hyperspace crap always makes me nauseous.
But dogs bark and caravan goes on.

#(ARRIVING_1)
We're getting close to our port of call.

#(ARRIVING_2)
Oh man, don't keep us waiting! Can't you see
how close we are to our destination, vacation and elation?

#(ARRIVED_1)
Wow-whee. It's time for some R&R when the boys have unloaded the cargo.

#(ARRIVED_2)
Unloading the containers and chilling.
We've been planet-hopping for kicks...

#(AT_PROCYON_1)
Too bad the R&R at Procyon means staring at endless flats of crystalline dust
and reading the highly entertaining Philosophic Book of Bzzbezzu Kzaaz.

#(AT_PROCYON_2)
One thing I tell you, it's pretty hard to find souvenirs down there.

#(whats_your_schedule)
Tell me about your schedule in general.

#(SCHEDULE_1)
We follow the standardized alliance freight schedule:
Freight convoys start from Sol to Procyon on
7th, 14th, 21st and 28th days of the month,
unless, of course, there already is a convoy underway.
As the Pkunk say
Don't put all your eggs in the same astral basket and so on. 

#(SCHEDULE_2)
The exciting life of a freighter captain consists of
four important dates: The 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th.
Every month, year after year, millennia after millennia
we start from Sol and end up in Procyon.
Yessir, we're as regular as Arcturian mega-clockwork!
There's a catch though: We have to hear the 
last convoy has arrived safely before we start a new one.
Who knows, there might be some
grand master planet eaters lurking just around the corner
waiting for some convoys to feed on.

#(good_bye_safe_trip)
Have a safe trip. You guys are the backbone of our fleet!

#(GOOD_BYE)
Yeah, right, mr. Shiny Precursor Vessel...
