#(VUX_GREETING1)
Oh. It's you.

#(VUX_GREETING2)
UGH, get AWAY from me human. 
Just because you are free to roam the galaxy while we are imprisoned
does not mean you get to impose your hideous presence on us.

#(greeting_1_who_you)
Umm, yes, it is me. Who are you?

#(STRONG_STOMACH)
The one with the strongest stomach.

#(greeting_1_whats_like)
So, what's it like over there?

#(TAKE_GUESS)
...Take a guess.

#(SILENT)
. . .

#(greeting_1_to_apology)
I never quite got around to finishing my apology for our unfortunate first contact. You ready?

#(KILL_LIKE_OTHERS)
Are you going to kill me if I don't accept it, like all the others?

#(whats_news)
Any news to report?

#(DAX_INFORMATION)
I was hoping you wouldn't ask that
as I am required to answer completely.
The one piece of news you are not already aware of is that ZEX's deviant subordinate DAX
managed to escape VUX space with a squadron of Intruders before the Chmmr closed in.
Actually, I'd tell you this anyway
The VUX are much better off without depraved individuals like DAX.
At least with ZEX we had an ace commander. DAX just gives me the willies. 
Should you stumble across him in your travels, please do the right thing
and dispose of him and his weirdo henchmen.

#(sb1_science_teams)
Did you have any science teams out investigating Precursor factories? No aces up your sleeves?

#(sb2_neglect_mismanagement)
Are you suffering from critical shortages due to neglect and mismanagement?

#(NOT_IDIOTS)
...No, we aren't idiots.

#(sb3_rethinking_position)
Are you rethinking your position on aliens?

#(ARGUMENT_SUBJECT)
There is some argument on this subject, yes.

#(sb4_seriously_how_is)
Seriously, how is it over there?

#(RANT)
Captain... we were minding our own business when the Ur-Quan invaded,
supported by fleets of Ilwrath, Umgah, and Spathi.
These four did not enhance our hopefulness for the goodness of unseen aliens,
which was already shocked by your captain Rand.
We were given the impossible choice of fight or die a slow death under the red slave shield.
Through the following war, we did as we were required upon pain of annihilation.
The many atrocities carried out on our people in the following war were not forgotten.
Yes, do not think that between us and the Syreen we did the most marauding.
We found our own brothers and sisters among the wreckage of the ships we destroyed
twisted, enthralled more perniciously than anything the Ur-Quan have done.
And in greater numbers than any paltry retaliation we inflicted upon the Syreen in return.
The war ended, and things began to look up.
The Ur-Quan standing orders were not too onerous, and they ruled with a light touch.
People began to be able to focus on the things important to them.
Then, along you came.
At no point did you mention the Kohr-Ah. If you had, we would surely now be seen as vital allies!
But you killed a war hero and looted his planet, and never looked back.
The next thing we knew we were overwhelmed by the Chmmr.
They confined us to one planet, and blocked the natural light we need.
In order to survive, our people live most of their lives indoors under carefully made lamps.
And of course some of us are compelled to come up here and offer assistance to the ones who imprisoned us.
...Not so good!

#(AFTER_RANT)
...you're joking.

#(sb5_safe_under_shield)
At least you weren't bombarded from orbit like us. And the shield is blue, especially for you.

#(SPITEFUL_VUX_1)
Not quite as bad as the Ur-Quan! Such high standards you keep.

#(SPITEFUL_VUX_2)
You humans must know from experience how humiliating this is. 
VUX were intergalactic masters while your species were still twigging on to the industrial revolution. 
You'll excuse me if I sound a little spiteful... it's because I am.

#(sb6_okay_then)
Okay, then.

#(apology_1)
I didn't kill them! I wasted a lot of fuel running away, too, I'll have you know!

#(APOLOGY_1_ANSWER)
A 'waste'. So telling.

#(apology_2)
They attacked me after I offered peace.

#(APOLOGY_2_ANSWER)
You used a peace offer to cover your invasion, complete with wiping out fleets.

#(apology_3)
No.

#(APOLOGY_3_ANSWER)
. . .

#(apology_4)
If you're going to be like that, never mind!

#(APOLOGY_4_ANSWER)
. . .

#(2apology_1)
Eh, whatever.

#(2APOLOGY_1_ANSWER)
A strong effort, captain. Bravo.

#(2apology_2)
I'm sorry that captain Rand was a meanie.

#(2APOLOGY_2_ANSWER)
Go on.

#(2apology_3)
I'm sorry captain Rand judged your appearance by standards that shouldn't apply to it.

#(2APOLOGY_3_ANSWER)
Certainly not! Go on.

#(2apology_4)
I'm sorry you guys heard his honest opinion. You shouldn't have been subjected to the truth that way.

#(2APOLOGY_4_ANSWER)
. . .

#(3apology_1)
I'm sorry that Star Control did not ensure that its captains were capable of controlling themselves.

#(3APOLOGY_1_ANSWER)
Go on. Back down to a single captain again. A different one... *ahem*

#(3apology_2)
What? I just apologized.

#(3APOLOGY_2_ANSWER)
. . .

#(3apology_3)
I'm sorry that humans find you extremely ugly. It's really a shame.

#(3APOLOGY_3_ANSWER)
It's unfortunate your aesthetic senses are so dull
but you don't want to change them, do you? 
Thought not. NOT SORRY.

#(3apology_4)
It's unfortunate that our sense of beauty is so dull as to be unable to perceive such magnificence.

#(3APOLOGY_4_ANSWER)
Yes, isn't it? Now, about you specifically...

#(4apology_1)
I'm sorry I didn't make more of an effort to bring you on board the New Alliance.

#(4APOLOGY_1_ANSWER)
Okay.

#(4apology_2)
I'm sorry I didn't intervene on your behalf to ensure more lenient treatment.

#(4APOLOGY_2_ANSWER)
Go on.

#(4apology_3)
That covers it, right?

#(4APOLOGY_3_ANSWER)
So gracious of you to apologize for the actions of others.

#(4apology_4)
Nope. I gave you guys a lot of chances!

#(4APOLOGY_4_ANSWER)
...

#(5apology_1)
Is there anything else? Can we be friends now?

#(5APOLOGY_1_ANSWER)
No, there's nothing else. No, I'm afraid that's still impossible.

#(5apology_2)
I'm sorry for... umm, help me out here.

#(5APOLOGY_2_ANSWER)
Your sincerity is infectious
It should be burned.

#(5apology_3)
Is there anything else I can do to help?

#(5APOLOGY_3_ANSWER)
Yes. You can cast down the Chmmr and free my people. That would help a lot.

#(5apology_4)
All apologized up! One step closer to retroactive 100% completion!

#(5APOLOGY_4_ANSWER)
I knew there had to be a reason for this.

#(6apology_1)
That's a tall order.

#(6APOLOGY_1_ANSWER)
So is being forgiven.

#(6apology_2)
Yeah, how about NO.

#(6APOLOGY_2_ANSWER)
The same to you, buddy.

#(6apology_3)
The Chmmr? Are you crazy? Those guys are scary!

#(6APOLOGY_3_ANSWER)
What a hero.

#(goodbye_vux)
Well, umm, nice meeting you. Sayonara.

#(GOODBYE_EARTHLING)
Finally!
