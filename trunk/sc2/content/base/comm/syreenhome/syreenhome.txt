#(SYREEN_GREETING1)
Hail Earthling, welcome to Syreen space. 
As always we are very pleased to welcome you. What brings you here? 

#(because_we_can)
We're here because we can be. Had the opportunity to visit so here we are!

#(looking_for_artefacts)
The Chmmr have sent us on a mission to find some missing Shofixti. Who, come to think of it, are nowhere near here.

#(spacebabes)
We're cruisin' for space-babes!

#(NICE_TUG)
If it's space-babes you're after it's space-babes you'll get I'm sure.
Nice tug by the way.

#(thanks_tug_complement)
Thanks! The Chmmr gave me this one, it's OKAY but not as cool as my old one...
you are talking about the vessel right?

#(not_fooled)
I'm not fooled by your dirty Syreen double entendres. Naughty!

#(DOUBLE_WHATNOW) 
Double what now? Anyway...

#(SURE_I_WAS)
Sure I was...

#(ANY_ASSISTANCE)
If there is any assistance you or your crew require
of a practical nature
you should stop by the starbase at our homeworld Betelgeuse I.

#(roam_stars)
It must be good to roam the stars once more.

#(WE_DONT_STRAY)
Well to be honest, we don't stray far from our homeworld. 
Our fleet is still rebuilding and there is the risk of running in to rogue Kohr-Ah
who still plague this part of space. 
We are grateful to the Chmmr who are diligent in their duty to eradicate these monsters. 

#(any_news)
Anything exciting going on around here?

#(NO_NEWS)
Right now we don't get out much, and most of the real activity
seems to be happening rim-ward of of Chmmr space where the Kohr-Ah are being pursued. 
We're now at the periphery of current events it seems.

#(spot_you_later)
We'll spot you later.

#(COME_BACK_ANYTIME)
Come back anytime.
