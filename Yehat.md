# Yehat #

  * **Connected races:** Pkunk
  * **Connected devices:**

## Summary info ##

Core member of NAFS. Don't quite know what role they will play, but they will be loyal to the [Chmmr](Chmmr.md) and may be difficult to deal with when relations with Chmmr take a nose-dive.

The starbase of the Yehat is in the works: you can visit it for nice graphics (Death star from the Return of the Jedi, anyone? ;), but it is yet unable to produce any services.

Yehat could be unsure how they are supposed to merge with the Pkunk biologically? What other plot elements do we give them?
