# Exotics communication tool #

  * **Connected races:** [Exotics](Exotics.md),
  * **Connected Devices:**

You need this to speak to Exotics.

> (I suggest merging this with the [BlackOrb](BlackOrb.md). See above. (Or perhaps this device needs a Black Orb to function) -- jorisvddonk)

Three alternatives:

  1. Maybe the Earth/[Chmmr](Chmmr.md) scientists would whip this device up after you�ve encountered & talked to an Exotic ship once (and lived to tell the tale). After visiting the starbase after the encounter, the commander would state that a team of their best Xeno-Linguistics starts working right away based on the recorded material from the encounter. The device (or rather, software ;) would be ready in a, say, two month's time. (The exact time wouldn't be told beforehand, but when visiting the starbase and enquiring about it he'd get info, like "it's nowhere near", "I think we've found logical connections between some syllables", "The team sent a message 'we're close to a breakthrough here... buzz off and let us work!'", "It's almost finished!" etc.
  1. Alternatively an Exotic needs to be captured and taken through a portal (I was thinking a Chmmr tractor beam would be necessary for that, so they'd have to be fixed by then). Then the Exotic would be taken to study by the Chmmr/humans.
  1. Or, you can use a [Taalo](Taalo.md) shield equivalent (or maybe a missile "dump-web", which attaches to a exotics's ship with does the same thing as a Taalo shield) to cut an exotic ship off from their hive mind. They can then interrogate the exotic using a psychics to get anything useful out of it. Maybe the [Syreen](Syreen.md)? Or, since we already have some plot elements for the Syreen, but not for the [Yehat](Yehat.md)/Pkunk, so we enroll Pkunk for this.

Which subplot do we choose for getting the communication tool???

(Cool details for alternative 3: Like the actual dialogue with Exotics, the psychic reading could also be such that it doesn't reveal all the cards in an instant. The Syreens (or pkunk) could be shocked at first at how different the mind of the Exotics is. They couldn't fathom it first... then they might start seeing images. Of a mesh, a net, galaxy-wide, a swarm of insects, something that would convey the hive-mind-like being of the Exotics... they might see a star system at the center/nodal point which is their home. But they might not see/hear the speech/thoughts of the Exotics directly. They would just interpret what they saw in the best way they could. They could go crazy. The Exotics hive mind might react as if it's hearing voices in the back of its head! We could have all sorts of weird shit there to freak the player out ;)
